<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>

<p>These chapters are not histories of sieges, but narratives
of such incidents as occur in beleaguered cities, and
illustrate human nature in some of its strangest moods.
That “facts are stranger than fiction” these stories go to
prove: such unexpected issues, such improbable interpositions
meet us in the pages of history. What writer
of fiction would dare to throw down battlements and
walls by an earthquake, and represent besiegers as paralysed
by religious fear? These tales are full, indeed,
of all the elements of romance, from the heroism and self-devotion
of the brave and the patient suffering of the
wounded, to the generosity of mortal foes and the
kindliness and humour which gleam even on the battle-field
and in the hospital. But the realities of war have
not been kept out of sight; now and then the veil has
been lifted, and the reader has been shown a glimpse of
those awful scenes which haunt the memory of even the
stoutest veteran.</p>

<p>We cannot realize fully the life that a soldier lives
unless we see both sides of that life. We cannot feel the
gratitude that we ought to feel unless we know the
strain and suspense, the agony and endurance, that go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
to make up victory or defeat. In time of war we are
full of admiration for our soldiers and sailors, but in the
past they have been too often forgotten or slighted when
peace has ensued. Not to keep in memory the great
deeds of our countrymen is mere ingratitude.</p>

<p>Hearty acknowledgments are due to the authors and
publishers who have so kindly permitted quotation from
their books. Every such permission is more particularly
mentioned in its place. The writer has also had many a
talk with men who have fought in the Crimea, in India,
in France, and in South Africa, and is indebted to them
for some little personal touches such as give life and
colour to a narrative.</p>

<p>Gibraltar! What a thrill does the very name evoke
to one who knows a little of English history and England’s
heroes! But to those who have the good fortune to
steam in a P. and O. liner down the coast of Portugal,
and catch sight of the Rock on turning by Cabrita Point
into the Bay of Algeciras the thrill of admiration is
intensified. For the great Rock lies like a lion couched
on the marge of the Mediterranean. It is one of the
pillars of Hercules: it commands the entrance to the
inner sea.</p>

<p>From 712 to the beginning of the fourteenth century
Gibraltar was in the hands of the Saracens; then it fell
into the hands of the Spaniards. In 1704, the year of
Blenheim, a combined English and Dutch fleet under
Sir George Rooke captured the Rock from the Marquis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
de Salines, and Gibraltar has since then remained in the
possession of the English, though several attempts
have been made to wrest it from us. Before we follow
Captain Drinkwater in some details of the great siege, a
few words must be said about the Rock and its defences
as they then were.</p>

<p>The Rock itself juts out like a promontory, rising to
a height of 1,300 feet, and joined to the Spanish mainland
by a low sandy isthmus, which is at the foot of the
Rock about 2,700 feet broad. On a narrow ledge at
the foot of the north-west slope lies the little town,
huddled up beneath the frowning precipice and bristling
batteries excavated out of the solid rock. At different
heights, up to the very crest, batteries are planted, half
or wholly concealed by the galleries. All along the sea-line
were bastions, mounted with great guns and howitzers,
and supplied with casemates for 1,000 men. In all the
fortifications were armed with 663 pieces of artillery.
Conspicuous among the buildings was an old Moorish
castle on the north-west side of the hill: here was planted
the Grand Battery, with the Governor’s residence at
the upper corner of the walls. Many caves and hollows
are found in the hill convenient both for powder
magazines and also for hiding-places to the apes who
colonize the Rock. The climate even at mid-winter is
so mild and warm that cricket and tennis can be played
on dry grass, wherever a lawn can be found in the
neighbourhood, as the writer has experienced. But at
Gibraltar itself all is stony ground and barren rock; only
on the western slope a few palmettos grow, with lavender
and Spanish broom, roses and asphodels.</p>

<p>In 1777 a good opportunity seemed to be offered
for Spain to recover the Rock from England. The
North American colonies had seceded, and the prestige
of Britain had suffered a severe blow. The fleets of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
France and Spain, sixty-six sail of the line, were opposed
by Sir Charles Hardy’s thirty-eight, but with these he
prevented the enemy from landing an invading army
on the English shore. But Spain was intent on retaking
Gibraltar, and had already planted batteries across the
isthmus which connects the Rock with Spain.</p>

<p>General Elliot, the Governor of Gibraltar, had a
garrison 5,382 strong, 428 artillerymen, and 106 engineers.
Admiral Duff had brought his ships&mdash;a sixty-gun
man-of-war, three frigates, and a sloop&mdash;alongside the
New Mole. All preparations were made to resist a siege.
Towards the middle of August the enemy succeeded in
establishing a strict blockade with the object of reducing
the garrison by famine. There were not more than
forty head of cattle in the place, and supplies from
Africa were intercepted by the Spanish cruisers. In
November the effects of scarcity began to be felt, though
many of the inhabitants had been sent away. Mutton
was three shillings a pound, ducks fourteen shillings a
couple; even fish and bread were very scarce. General
Elliot set the example of abstemious living, and for
eight days he lived on 4 ounces of rice a day. The
inhabitants had for some time been put upon a daily
ration of bread, delivered under the protection of sentries
with fixed bayonets. But even with this safeguard for
the week there was a scene of struggling daily. Many
times the stronger got more than their share, the weaker
came away empty-handed, and eked out a wretched
existence on leeks and thistles. Even soldiers and their
families were perilously near starvation. So that a
listless apathy fell on the majority, and they looked
seaward in vain for a help that did not arrive.</p>

<p>It was not until the 15th of January, 1780, that the
joyful news went round the little town of a brig in the
offing which bore the British flag.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>“She cannot pass the batteries!”</p>

<p>“She is standing in for the Old Mole! Hurrah!”</p>

<p>That brig brought the tidings of approaching relief,
and many a wet eye kindled with hope.</p>

<p>But the look-out on Signal Point could see the Spaniards
in Algeciras Bay preparing for sea eleven men-of-war
to cut off the convoy. Again the hopes of the garrison
went down. They did not know, neither did the
Spaniards, that Admiral Sir George Rodney, an old
Harrow boy, was escorting the convoy with a powerful
fleet of twenty-one sail of the line. He quickly drove
the eleven Spaniards into headlong flight, but before
rounding into the bay he fell in with fifteen Spanish
merchant-men and six ships of war, which became his
prize.</p>

<p>Then for a time the town and garrison enjoyed themselves
frugally, and life became worth living. But on
the departure of Rodney the Spaniards tried to destroy
the British vessels in the bay with fire-ships.</p>

<p>It was on a June night that the fire spread, and the
gleam shot across the water, lighting up Algeciras and the
cork forests that clothe the mountain-side. Then the
alarm was given. The <i>Panther</i>, a sixty-gun man-of-war,
and the other armed ships opened fire on the assailants;
officers and men sprang into their boats and grappled
the blazing ships, making fast hawsers, and towing them
under the great guns of the Rock, where they were
promptly sunk.</p>

<p>Again the blight of ennui, sickness, and famine came
on the little garrison; but in October a cargo of fruit
came just in time to save them from scurvy. In March,
1781, the want of bread became serious: biscuit crumbs
were selling for a shilling a pound. “How long?” was
the anxious cry that was felt, if not expressed in words.
Had England forgotten her brave men?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 12th of April, to the joyful surprise of all, a great
convoy was signalled, escorted by a strong fleet. Every
man, woman, and child who could walk came out upon
the ramparts and gazed seawards with glistening eyes.
At daybreak, says the historian of the siege, “Admiral
Darby’s much-expected fleet was in sight from our
signal-house, but was not discernible from below, being
obscured by a thick mist in the Gut. As the sun rose,
however, the fog rose too like the curtain of a vast
theatre, discovering to the anxious garrison one of the
most beautiful and pleasing scenes it is possible to
conceive. The ecstasies of the inhabitants at this
grand and exhilarating sight are not to be described;
but, alas! they little dreamed of the tremendous blow
that impended, which was to annihilate their property,
and reduce many of them to indigence and beggary.”</p>

<p>For this second relief of the garrison stung the Spaniards
into the adoption of a measure which inflicted a large
amount of suffering on the citizens. They at once began
to bombard the town with sixty-four heavy guns and
fifty mortars. All amongst the crowds in the narrow,
winding streets, through the frail roofs and windows, came
shot and shell, so that one and all fled from their homes,
seeking cover among the rocks. This was the time for
thieves to operate, and many houses were rifled of their
contents. Then it was discovered that many hucksters
and liquor-dealers had been hoarding and hiding their
stocks, and a fire having broken out in a wine-shop,
the soldiers tasted and drank to excess. Then in a few
days the discipline became relaxed; many of the garrison
stole and took away to their quarters barrels of wine,
which they proceeded to stow away, to their own peril and
ruin. At length General Elliot was compelled to issue
orders that any soldier found drunk or asleep at his post
should be shot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>What surprises us in our days of long-distance firing
is the strange fact that a man with sharp vision could
see one of the cannon-balls as it came towards him.
One day, we are told, an officer saw a ball coming his
way, but he was so fascinated by it that he could not
move out of the way. Another day a shot fell into a
house in which nearly twenty people were gathered
together: all escaped except one child. On another
occasion a shot came through the embrasures of one of
the British batteries, took off the legs of two men, one
leg of another, and wounded a fourth man in both legs,
so that “four men had seven legs taken off and wounded
by one shot.” A boy who had been posted on the
works, on account of his keenness of vision, to warn the
men when a cannon-ball was coming their way, had
only just been complaining that they did not heed his
warnings, and while he turned to the men this shot
which did all this hurt was fired by the enemy. A large
cannon-ball in those days weighed 30 pounds, others
much less. The author remembers Admiral Colomb
telling the Harrow boys in a lecture that a Captain of
those days could carry two or more cannon-balls in his
coat-tail pocket; the balls of modern guns have to be
moved by hydraulic machinery. Yet it is astonishing
how much damage the old cannon-balls could inflict,
lopping along like overgrown cricket-balls as they did.</p>

<p>Sometimes incidents happened of an amusing character.</p>

<p>One day a soldier was rummaging about among the
ruins of a fallen house, and came upon a find of watches
and jewels. He bethought him at once of a very pretty
Spanish girl who had coquetted with him in the gardens
of the Alameda.</p>

<p>“Now, let me see,” he murmured to himself, “how
can I put this away safe? Little Catalina will laugh
when she sees them there jewels, I’ll be bound! Humph!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
I can’t take this lot to quarters, that’s sartin! Them
sergeants, as feel one all round on return from duty, will
grab the lot.”</p>

<p>So he walked on, musing and pondering over his
weighty affair.</p>

<p>As he was passing the King’s Bastion a happy thought
struck him.</p>

<p>“By George, sir!” he said to himself, “it’s just the
very thing. Who would think of looking for a watch
inside a gun?” and he chuckled to himself.</p>

<p>It was high noon; the sentinel seemed half asleep. The
soldier tied up his prize in his handkerchief, took out the
wad of the gun, and slipped his treasure-trove into the
bore of the cannon, replacing the wad carefully. That
evening he met Catalina, and managed to inform her
that he had a pleasant surprise for her, if she could come
to the King’s Bastion.</p>

<p>Her dark eyes glanced mischievously.</p>

<p>“No, not in the evening, I thank you, Jacko. I will
come to-morrow, an hour ofter sunrise.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Catalina; I see you do not trust me. To-morrow,
then, you shall come with me to the King’s Bastion,
and see with your own eyes how rich I can make you.”</p>

<p>Catalina understood enough English to laugh heartily
at her lover’s grave and mysterious words.</p>

<p>“He has stolen a loaf and a bottle of wine,” she thought
in her simplicity.</p>

<p>However, Catalina did not disappoint Jack, and
together they paced towards the semi-circular platform
of the King’s Bastion.</p>

<p>Jack was a very proud man as he tried to explain to his
lady-love what a surprise was in store for her: he touched
her wrists to show how the bracelets would fit, and her
shapely neck to prove the existence of a splendid necklace,
and Catalina began to believe her boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>But as they came out upon the gun platform, Jack
stopped suddenly, and uttered a fearful oath.</p>

<p>“O dios!” cried the maid, “what is there to hurt,
Jacko?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you see? Oh, Catalina, the game is up!
That devil of a gunner is wiping out the bore of his gun!”</p>

<p>Jack ran up, and, seizing the man by the arm, said:
“I say, mate, if you have found a parcel in that gun, it’s
mine! I put it in last night. I tell you it’s mine, mate!
Don’t you try to make believe you have not seen it, ’cos
I know you has.”</p>

<p>The gunner stared in open-mouthed astonishment at the
speaker. At last he said, with a touch of sarcasm:</p>

<p>“What for do you think I am wiping out her mouth,
you silly! You must have slept pretty sound not to
know that them gun-boats crept up again last night.”</p>

<p>“The devil take them! Then, where’s that gold watch
of mine and them jewels? I put ’em for safety in that
fool of a gun.”</p>

<p>“Oh, then, you may depend upon it, my lad, that the
watch-glass has got broke, for we fired a many rounds in
the night.”</p>

<p>“What for you look so to cry?” asked little Catalina
in wonder.</p>

<p>“Oh, come away, sweetheart. You’ll get no rich present
this year; them Spaniards have collared ’em all. O
Lord! O Lord!”</p>

<p>On the 7th of July the Spaniards at Cabrita Point were
seen to be signalling the approach of an enemy. As the
mists melted away, the garrison could see a ship becalmed
out in the bay. Fourteen gunboats from Algeciras had put
out to cut her off; on this, Captain Curtis, of the <i>Brilliant</i>,
ordered three barges to row alongside, and receive any
dispatches she might have on board. This was done just
before the leading Spanish gunboat got within range;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
then came a hideous storm of round and grape shot as
the fourteen gunboats circled round the <i>Helma</i>.</p>

<p>But Captain Roberts, though he had only fourteen
small guns, returned their fire gallantly. The English
sloop was lying becalmed about a league from the Rock,
and the garrison in Gibraltar could do nothing to help her.
They looked every minute to see the <i>Helma</i> sink, but still
she battled on against their 26-pounders.</p>

<p>Then, when hope seemed desperate, a westerly breeze
sprang up; the waters darkened and rippled round the
<i>Helma</i>, her canvas slowly filled out, and she came away
with torn sails and rigging to the shelter of the Mole.</p>

<p>In September, 1782, a grand attack was made by the
Spaniards with ten men-of-war, gunboats, mortar-boats,
and floating batteries. They took up their position about
900 yards from the King’s Bastion. Four hundred pieces
of the heaviest artillery were crashing and thundering,
while all the air was thick with smoke. General Elliott
had made his preparations: the round shot was being
heated in portable furnaces all along the front, and as the
furnaces were insufficient, huge fires were lit in the angles
between buildings on which our “roast potatoes,” as
the soldiers nicknamed the hot shot, were being baked.</p>

<p>But the enemy’s battering-ships seemed invulnerable.
“Our heaviest shells often rebounded from their tops,
whilst the 32-pound shot seemed incapable of making
any visible impression upon their hulls. Frequently we
flattered ourselves they were on fire, but no sooner did
any smoke appear than, with admirable intrepidity, men
were observed applying water from their engines within
to those places whence the smoke issued. Even the artillery
themselves at this period had their doubts of the
effect of the red-hot shot, which began to be used about
twelve, but were not general till between one and two
o’clock.” After some hours’ incessant firing, the masts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
of several Spanish ships were seen to be toppling over;
the flag-ship and the Admiral’s second ship were on fire,
and on board some others confusion was seen to be prevailing.
Their fire slackened, while ours increased.
Then, as night came on, the gleams spread across the
troubled waters; the cannonade of the garrison increased
in rapidity and power. At one in the morning two ships
were blazing mast-high, and the others soon caught fire
from the red-hot shot or from the flying sparks. The
light and glow of this fearful conflagration brought out
the weird features of the whole bay: the sombre Rock,
the blood-red sea, the white houses of Algeciras five miles
across, the dark cork forests, and the Spanish mountains&mdash;all
stood out in strange perspective. Amid the roar of
cannon were fitfully heard the hoarse murmurs of the
crowds that lined the shore and the screams of burning
men. Sometimes a deep gloom shrouded the background
of earth and sea, while gigantic columns of curling, serpent
flame shot up from the blazing hulls.</p>

<p>Brigadier Curtis, who was encamped at Europa Point,
now took out his flotilla of twelve gunboats, each being
armed with a 24-pounder in its bow, and took the floating
batteries in flank, compelling the Spanish relieving boats
to retire.</p>

<p>Daylight showed a sight never to be forgotten: the
flames had paled before the sun, but the dark forms of the
Spaniards moving amongst the fire and shrieking for help
and compassion stirred all the feelings of humanity.
Some were clinging to the sides of the burning ships,
others were flinging themselves into the waves. Curtis
led his boats up to the smoking hulks in order to rescue
some of the victims. He and his men climbed on board
the battering-ships at the risk of their lives, and helped
down the Spaniards, who were profuse in their expressions
of gratitude.</p>

<p class="header">The Last Siege of Gibraltar by France and Spain</p>

<p>A floating battery may be seen to the extreme left beyond the heeling ship.</p></div>
</div>

<p>But as the English thus worked for the rescue of their
enemies, the magazine of one of the Spanish ships blew
up with a crash at about five o’clock, and a quarter of an
hour after another exploded in the centre of the line.
Burning splinters were hurled around in all directions,
and involved the British gunboats in grave danger. In
the Brigadier’s boat his coxswain was killed, his stroke
wounded, and a hole was forced through the bottom of the
boat. After landing 357 Spaniards, the English were
compelled to retire under the cover of the Rock, leaving
the remainder to their dreadful fate. Of the six ships still
on fire, three blew up before eleven o’clock; the other
three burned down to the water’s edge.</p>

<p>Thus ended the attempt to take the Rock by means of
floating castles. The loss sustained by the Spaniards was
about 2,000 killed, wounded, and taken prisoners;
whereas the losses in the garrison were surprisingly small,
considering how long a cannonade had been kept up
upon the forts: 16 only were killed; 18 officers, sergeants,
and rank and file were wounded. Yet the enemy
had been firing more than 300 pieces of heavy ordnance,
while the English garrison could bring to bear only 80
cannon, 7 mortars, and 9 howitzers; but even for these
they expended 716 barrels of powder.</p>

<p>As Admiral Lord Howe was sailing with a powerful
fleet to the help of Gibraltar, he heard the news of General
Elliot’s splendid defence. On the night of the 18th of October,
1782, a great storm scattered the French and Spanish
ships; and soon after the delighted garrison saw Lord
Howe’s fleet and his convoy, containing fresh troops and
provisions, approaching in order of battle. The blockade
was now virtually at an end. The siege had lasted three
years, seven months, and twelve days. Since then no
attempt has been made to capture Gibraltar.</p>

In the spring of 1798 he set out for Egypt, reducing
Malta on the way, and just eluding Nelson’s fleet.</p>

<p>He had got as far as Cairo when he heard of Nelson’s
victory in Aboukir Bay, where his French fleet was
destroyed.</p>

<p>But Bonaparte, undaunted, pressed on to attack
Syria. He stormed Jaffa, and put the garrison to the
sword. Not content with this cruelty, he marched the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
townsfolk, to the number of 3,700, into the middle of a
vast square, formed by the French troops. The poor
wretches shed no tears, uttered no cries. Some who
were wounded and could not march so fast as the rest
were bayonetted on the way.</p>

<p>The others were halted near a pool of dirty, stagnant
water, divided into small bodies, marched in different
directions, and there shot down. When the French
soldiers had exhausted their cartridges, the sword and
bayonet finished the business. Sir Sidney Smith, a
Captain commanding a few ships in the Levant, hearing
of these atrocities, hurried with his ships to St. Jean
d’Acre, which lies north of Jaffa, on the north end of the
bay which is protected on the south by the chalk headland
of Carmel, jutting out like our Beachy Head far into
the sea.</p>

<p>Sir Sidney arrived in the <i>Tigre</i> at Acre only two days
before Bonaparte appeared. On the 17th of March he sent
the <i>Tigre’s</i> boats by night to the foot of Mount Carmel, and
there they found the French advanced guard encamped
close to the water’s edge. The boats opened with grape,
and the French retired in a hurry up the side of the
mount.</p>

<p>The main body of the army, hearing that the sea-road
was exposed to gun-fire from British ships, went round
by Nazareth and invested Acre to the east. A French
corvette and nine sail of gun vessels coming round Mount
Carmel, found themselves close to the English fleet, and
seven of them were made prizes, manned from the ships,
and employed to harass the enemy’s posts.</p>

<p>The French trenches were opened on the 20th of March
with thirty-two cannon, but they were deficient in balls.
The French General, Montholon, tells us how they made
the English provide them with cannon-balls. It reminds
us of our own plan at Jellalabad. He says that Napoleon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
from time to time ordered a few waggons to be driven
near the sea, on sight of which Sir Sidney would send in
shore one of his ships and pour a rolling fire around the
waggons. Presently the French troops would run to the
spot, collect all the balls they could find and bring them
in to the Director of Artillery, receiving five sous for each
ball. This they did, while laughter resounded on every
side. The French could afford to be merry. Under
Bonaparte they had become the masters of the greater
part of Europe. Nothing seemed impossible to them
under that military genius. Here they were besieging a
little trumpery Syrian town, which they calculated they
could take in three days; “for,” said they, “it is not so
strong as Jaffa. Its garrison only amounts to 2,000
or 3,000 men, whereas Jaffa had a garrison of 8,000
Turks.”</p>

<p>On the 25th of March the French had made a breach in
the tower which was considered practicable. A young
officer with fifteen sappers and twenty-five Grenadiers,
was ordered to mount to the assault and clear the tower
fort; but a counter-scarp 15 feet high stopped them.
Many were wounded, and they hastily retired. On the
28th a mine was sprung, and they assaulted again;
but “the Turks exerted themselves so far on this occasion,”
writes Sir Sidney, “as to knock the assailants off
their ladders into the ditch, where about forty of their
bodies now lie.” Montholon writes: “The breach was
found to be too high by several feet, and Mailly, an officer
of the staff, and others were killed. When the Turks
saw Adjutant Lusigier fixing the ladder, a panic seized
them, and many fled to the port. Even Djezzar, the
Governor, had embarked. It was very unfortunate.
That was the day on which the town ought to have been
taken.”</p>

<p>Early in April a sortie took place, in which the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
Marines were to force their way into the French mine,
while the Turks attacked the trenches. The sally took
place just before daylight, but the noise and shouting
of the Turks rendered the attempt to surprise the enemy
useless; but they succeeded in destroying part of the
mine, at considerable loss. The Turks brought in above
sixty heads, many muskets and entrenching tools. “We
have taught the besiegers,” writes Sir Sidney, “to respect
the enemy they have to deal with, so as to keep at a
greater distance.” On the 1st of May the enemy, after many
hours’ heavy cannonade from thirty pieces of artillery
brought from Jaffa, made a fourth attempt to mount the
breach, now much widened, but were repulsed with loss.</p>

<p>“The <i>Tigre</i> moored on one side and the <i>Theseus</i> on
the other, flank the town walls, and the gunboats,
launches, etc., flank the enemy’s trenches, to their great
annoyance. Nothing but desperation can induce them
to make the sort of attempts they do to mount the breach
under such a fire as we pour in upon them; and it is
impossible to see the lives, even of our enemies, thus
sacrificed, and so much bravery misapplied, without
regret. I must not omit to mention, to the credit of the
Turks, that they fetch gabions, fascines, and other
material which the garrison does not afford from the
face of the enemy’s works.”</p>

<p>By the 9th of May the French had on nine several occasions
attempted to storm, but had been beaten back with
immense slaughter. On the fifty-first day of the siege
the English had been reinforced by Hassan Bey with
corvettes and transports; but this only made Bonaparte
attack with more ferocity, having protected themselves
with sand-bags and the bodies of their dead built in with
them. It was a touch and go whether the French would
not fight their way in. A group of Generals was assembled
on Cœur-de-Lion’s Mount, among whom Napoleon was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
distinguishable, as he raised his glasses and gesticulated.
At this critical moment Sir Sidney landed his boats at
the mole and took the crews up to the breach armed with
pikes. The enthusiastic gratitude of the Turks&mdash;men,
women, and children&mdash;at sight of such a reinforcement is
not to be described. The few Turks who were standing
their ground in the breach were flinging heavy stones
down on the heads of the advancing foe, but many of the
French mounted to the heap of ruins in the breach so
close that the muzzles of their muskets touched and their
spear-heads locked.</p>

<p>Djezzar Pasha, on hearing that so large a force of the
English were fighting in the breach, left his seat, where,
according to Turkish custom, he was sitting to distribute
rewards to such as should bring him the heads of the
enemy, and coming behind our men, the energetic old
man pulled back his English friends with violence, saying,
“If any harm happen to the English, all is lost.”</p>

<p>A sally made by the Turks in another quarter caused
the French in the trenches to uncover themselves above
their parapet, so that the fire from our boats brought
down numbers of them. A little before sunset a massive
column came up to the breach with solemn step. By the
Pasha’s orders a good number of the French were let
in, and they descended from the rampart into the Pasha’s
garden, where in a very few minutes their bravest lay
headless corpses, the sabre proving more than a match
for the bayonet. The rest, seeing what was done, fled
precipitately. The breach was now practicable for fifty
men abreast. “We felt,” says Sir Sidney, “that we
must defend it at all costs, for by this breach Bonaparte
means to march to further conquest, and on the issue
of this conflict depends the conduct of the thousands of
spectators who sit on the surrounding hills, waiting to
see which side they shall join.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>With regard to the cutting off of heads by the Turks,
one day, when out riding, Sir Sidney questioned the
superior metal of the Damascus blade, when Djezzar
Pasha replied that such a blade would separate the head
from the body of any animal without turning the edge.</p>

<p>“Look!” said the Pasha; “this one I carry about with
me never fails. It has taken off some dozens of heads.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Pasha,” said Sir Sidney. “Could you not
give me ocular proof of the merit of your Damascus, and
at the same time of your own expertness, by slicing off,
<i>en passant</i>, the head of one of the oxen we are now
approaching?”</p>

<p>“Ah, q’oui, monsieur, c’est déjà fait;” and springing
off at a gallop, he smote a poor ox as it was grazing close
to the path, and the head immediately rolled on the
ground. A Damascus sabre regards neither joints nor
bones, but goes slicing through, and you cannot feel any
dint on the edge thereof.</p>

<p>On the 14th of May Sir Sidney writes to his brother:
“Our labour is excessive: many of us have died of fatigue.
I am but half dead, and nearly blinded by sun and sand.
Bonaparte brings fresh troops to the assault two or three
times in the night, and so we are obliged to be always
under arms. He has lost the flower of his army in these
desperate attempts to storm, as appears by the certificates
of former services which we find in their pockets. We
have been now near two months constantly under fire
and firing. We cannot guard the coast lower down than
Mount Carmel, for the Pasha tells me, if we go away, the
place will fall, so that the French get supplies from Jaffa
to the south. I sent Captain Miller in the <i>Theseus</i>
yesterday to chase three French frigates off Cæsarea;
but, alas! seventy shells burst at the forepart of Captain
Miller’s cabin, killing him and thirty-two men, including
some who jumped overboard and were drowned.” The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
ship got on fire in five places, but was saved. By the 16th
of May Bonaparte had lost eight Generals and most of his
artillerymen&mdash;in all upwards of 4,000 men. The Turks
were becoming quite brave and confident. They boldly
rushed in on the assaulting columns, sabre in hand, and
cut them to pieces before they could fire twice. But they
were struck with terror at the thought of the mines which
they imagined might blow up at any time, and could not
be forced to remain on the walls or in the tower. However,
the knowledge which the garrison had of the
massacre at Jaffa rendered them desperate in their personal
defence.</p>

<p>In the fourteenth assault General Kleber led his victorious
troops to the breach. It was a grand and terrific
spectacle. The Grenadiers rushed forward under a
shower of balls. Kleber, with the gait of a giant, with
his thick head of hair and stentorian voice, had taken his
post, sword in hand, on the bank of the breach. The
noise of the cannon, the rage of the soldiers, the yells of
the Turks, were all bewildering and awful.</p>

<p>General Bonaparte, standing on the battery of the
breach, looking rather paler than usual, was following the
progress of the assault through his glass, when a ball
passed above his head; but he would not budge. In vain
did Berthier ask him to quit this perilous post&mdash;he received
no answer&mdash;and two or three officers were killed
close to him; yet he made no sign of moving from the
spot. All at once the column of the besiegers came to
a standstill. Bonaparte went further forward, and then
perceived that the ditch was vomiting out flames and
smoke. It was impossible to go on. Kleber, in a great
rage, struck his thigh with his sword and swore. But
the General-in-Chief, judging the obstacle to be insurmountable,
gave a gesture and ordered a retreat. After
this failure the French Grenadiers absolutely refused to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
mount the breach any more over the putrid bodies of
their unburied companions. Bonaparte for once seems
to have lost his judgment, first by sacrificing so many of
his best men in trying to take a third-rate fort; and,
secondly, because, even if he had succeeded in taking the
town, the fire of the English ships must have driven him
out again in a short time.</p>

<p>One last desperate throw was made for success by
sending an Arab dervish with a letter to the Pasha proposing
a cessation of arms for the purpose of burying the
dead. During the conference of the English and Turkish
Generals on this subject a volley of shot and shells on a
sudden announced an assault; but the garrison was ready,
and all they did was to increase the numbers of the slain,
to the disgrace of the General who thus disloyally sacrificed
them. The game was up after a siege of sixty
days: in the night following the 20th of May the French
army began to retreat. But as they could not carry their
guns and wounded with them, these were hurried to sea
without seamen to navigate the ships, in want of water
and food. They steered straight for the English ships,
and claimed and received succour. Their expressions of
gratitude to Sir Sidney were mingled with execrations on
their General for his cruel treatment of them. English
boats rowed along the shore and harassed their march
south. The whole track between Acre and Gaza was
strewn with the dead bodies of those who had sunk under
fatigue or from their wounds. At Gaza Bonaparte turned
inland, but there he was much molested by the Arabs.
The remnant of a mighty host went on, creeping towards
Egypt in much confusion and disorder.</p>

<p>Sir Sidney Smith had thus defeated the great General
of France, who grudgingly said: “This man has made
me miss my destiny.” In the hour of victory Sir Sidney
was generous and humane, for he had a good heart, good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
humour, and much pity. Nor did he forget the Giver
of all victory, as the following extract from a letter
testifies:</p>

<p>“<i>Nazareth, 1799.</i>&mdash;I am just returned from the Cave of
the Annunciation, where, secretly and alone, I have been
returning thanks to the Almighty for our late wonderful
success. Well may we exclaim, ‘the race is not always
to the swift, nor the battle to the strong.’&mdash;W. S. S.”</p>

<span class="smaller">THE WOUNDED CAPTAIN IN TALAVERA (1809)</span></h2>

<p class="summary">Talavera between two fires&mdash;Captain Boothby wounded&mdash;Brought into
Talavera&mdash;The fear of the citizens&mdash;The surgeons’ delay&mdash;Operations
without chloroform&mdash;The English retire&mdash;French troops
arrive&mdash;Plunder&mdash;French officers kind, and protect Boothby&mdash;A
private bent on loot beats a hasty retreat.</p>

<p>Captain Boothby, of the Royal Engineers, left behind
him a diary of his experiences in Spain during part of
the Peninsular War in 1809. It will help us to understand
how much suffering war inflicts, and how much pain
we have been saved by the inventions of modern science.</p>

<p>He tells us he had been provided with quarters in
Talavera, at the house of Donna Pollonia di Monton, a
venerable dame. She was the only person left in the
house, the rest having fled to the mountains in fear lest
the French should come and sack the city; for in the
streets those who remained were shouting in their panic,
“The French have taken the suburbs!” or “The British
General is in full retreat!” or “O Dios! los Ingleses nos
abandonan!” (“O God! the English are deserting us!”).
The fact was that Wellesley was not sure if he could hold
his ground at Talavera.</p>

<p>Captain Boothby went out one morning towards the
enemy’s position; he was brought back in the evening
on a bier by four men, his leg shattered by a musket-ball.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
The old lady threw up her hands when she saw him
return.</p>

<p>“What!” she exclaimed, while the tears ran down
her cheeks. “Can this be the same? This he whose
cheeks in the morning were glowing with health? Blessed
Virgin, see how white they are now!”</p>

<p>She made haste to prepare a bed.</p>

<p>“Oh, what luxury to be laid upon it, after the hours
of pain and anxiety, almost hopeless, I had undergone!
The surgeon, Mr. Bell, cut off my boot, and having
examined the wound, said:</p>

<p>“‘Sir, I fear there is no chance of saving your leg,
and the amputation must be above the knee.’</p>

<p>“He said the operation could not be performed until
the morning, and went back to the hospital.</p>

<p>“I passed a night of excruciating pain. My groans
were faint, because my body was exhausted with the
three hours’ stumbling about in the woods. Daylight
was ushered in by a roar of cannon so loud, so continuous,
that I hardly conceived the wars of all the earth
could produce such a wild and illimitable din. Every
shot seemed to shake the house with increasing violence,
and poor Donna Pollonia rushed in crying:</p>

<p>“‘They are firing the town!’</p>

<p>“‘No, no,’ said I; ‘don’t be frightened. Why should
they fire the town? Don’t you perceive that the firing
is becoming more distant?’”</p>

<p>So the poor lady became less distraught, and watched
by him with sympathizing sorrow. But at length, finding
the day advancing, his pains unabating, and no signs
of any medical help coming, he tore a leaf from his
pocket-book, and with a pencil wrote a note to the chief
surgeon, Mr. Higgins, saying that, as he had been informed
no time was to be lost in the amputation, he was naturally
anxious that his case should be attended to. The mes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>senger
returned, saying that the surgeon could not possibly
leave the hospital. He sent a second note, and a
third, and towards ten o’clock a.m. the harrassed surgeon
made his appearance.</p>

<p>“Captain Boothby,” said he, “I am extremely sorry
that I could not possibly come here before, still more
sorry that I only come now to tell you I cannot serve
you. There is but one case of instruments. This I cannot
bring from the hospital while crowds of wounded,
both officers and men, are pressing for assistance.”</p>

<p>“I did but wish to take my turn,” said the Captain.</p>

<p>“I hope,” he added, “that towards evening the crowd
will decrease, and that I shall be able to bring Mr. Gunning
with me to consult upon your case.”</p>

<p>“Will you examine my wound, sir,” said Boothby,
“and tell me honestly whether you apprehend any
danger from the delay?”</p>

<p>He examined the leg, and said:</p>

<p>“No, I see nothing in this case from which the danger
would be increased by waiting five or six hours.”</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but patience.</p>

<p>“I taxed my mind to make an effort, but pain, far
from loosening his fangs at the suggestion of reason, clung
fast, and taught me that, in spite of mental pride, he is,
and must be, dreadful to the human frame.”</p>

<p>Mr. Higgins came to him about three o’clock, bringing
with him Mr. Gunning and Mr. Bell, and such instruments
as they might have occasion for.</p>

<p>Mr. Gunning sat down by his bedside, and made a
formal exhortation: explained that to save the life it
was necessary to part with the limb, and he required of
him an effort of mind and a manly resolution.</p>

<p>“Whatever is necessary, that I am ready to bear,”
said the Captain.</p>

<p>Then the surgeons, having examined his wound, went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
to another part of the room to consult, after which they
withdrew&mdash;to bring the apparatus, as he imagined.
Hours passed, and they did not return. His servant,
Aaron, having sought Mr. Gunning, was told that he was
too much occupied. This after having warned him that
there was no time to be lost!</p>

<p>“Go, then,” said the Captain to Aaron&mdash;“go into the
street, and bring me the first medical officer you happen
to fall in with.”</p>

<p>He returned, bringing with him Mr. Grasset, surgeon
of the 48th Regiment.</p>

<p>After examining the wound, Mr. Grasset declared that
he was by no means convinced of the necessity of the
amputation, and would not undertake the responsibility.</p>

<p>“But,” said the wounded man, “I suppose an attempt
to save the leg will be attended with great danger.”</p>

<p>“So will the amputation,” he replied. “But we must
hope for the best, and I see nothing to make your cure
impossible. The bones, to be sure, are much shattered,
and the leg is much mangled and swollen; but have you
been bled, sir?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Captain Boothby.</p>

<p>Mr. Grasset conceived bleeding absolutely necessary,
though he had already lost much, and at his request he
bled him in the arm.</p>

<p>He guessed that Mr. Gunning’s departure proceeded
from his conviction that a gangrene had already begun,
and that it would be cruel to disturb his dying moments
by a painful and fruitless operation.</p>

<p>As he had taken nothing but vinegar and water since
his misfortune, his strength was exhausted, and the
operation of bleeding was succeeded by an interval of
unconsciousness. From this state he was roused by
some one taking hold of his hand. It was his friend Dr.
FitzPatrick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>“If I had you in London,” said he with a sigh, “I
might attempt to save your limb; but amid the present
circumstances it would be hopeless. I had been told
that the amputation had been performed, else, ill as I
could have been spared, I would have left the field and
come to you.”</p>

<p>“Do you think you are come too late?” asked the
Captain.</p>

<p>He said “No”; but he dissembled. At that time
Boothby was under strong symptoms of lockjaw, which
did not disappear until many hours after the operation.
The doctor took a towel, and soaking it in vinegar and
water, laid it on the wound, which gave much relief.
He stayed with him till late, changing the lotion as often
as needed. The operation was fixed for daylight on the
morrow.</p>

<p>The patient passed another dismal night. At nine
o’clock next morning FitzPatrick and Miller, Higgins and
Bell, staff-surgeons, came to his bedside. They had put
a table in the middle of the room, and placed on it a
mattress. Then one of the surgeons came and exhorted
him to summon his fortitude. Boothby told him he need
not be afraid, and FitzPatrick said he could answer for
him. They then carried him to the table and laid him
on the mattress. Mr. Miller wished to place a handkerchief
over his eyes, but he assured him that it was
unnecessary; he would look another way.</p>

<p>“I saw that the knife was in FitzPatrick’s hand, which
being as I wished, I averted my head.</p>

<p>“I will not shock the reader by describing the operation
in detail, but as it is a common idea that the most
painful part of an operation lies in sundering the bone,
I may rectify an error by declaring that the only part
of the process in which the pain comes up to the natural
anticipation is the first incision round the limb, by which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
the skin is divided, the sensation of which is as if a prodigious
weight were impelling the severing edge. The
sawing of the bone gives no uneasy sensation; or, if any,
it is overpowered by others more violent.</p>

<p>“‘Is it off?’ said I, as I felt it separate.</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ said FitzPatrick, ‘your sufferings are over.’</p>

<p>“‘Ah no! you have yet to take up the arteries.’</p>

<p>“‘It will give you no pain,’ he said kindly; and that
was true&mdash;at least, after what I had undergone, the pain
seemed nothing.</p>

<p>“I was carried back to my bed much exhausted.
Soon hope returned to my breast; it was something to
have preserved the possibility of yet being given back
to happiness and friendship.”</p>

<p>For some time after the operation his stomach refused
sustenance, and a constant hiccough was recognized by
the surgeons as a fatal prognostic.</p>

<p>His faithful friend, Edmund Mulcaster, hardly ever
left his bedside. General Sherbrooke came to see him often,
and evinced the most earnest anxiety for his welfare.
They wrote to his friends for him, and to his mother.
This last he signed himself.</p>

<p>In the night of the 30th, by the perseverance of Mulcaster,
he managed to retain some mulled wine, strongly
spiced, and in the morning took two eggs from the same
welcome hand. This was the “turn.” The unfavourable
symptoms began to subside, and the flowing stream
of life began to fill by degrees its almost deserted channels.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of August some officers, entering his room,
said that information had been received of Soult’s
arrival at Placentia, and that General Wellesley intended
to head back and engage him.</p>

<p>“If the French come while we are away, Boothby,”
said Goldfinch, “you must cry out, ‘Capitaine anglais,’
and you will be treated well.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 3rd of August his friends all came to take leave
of him. It was a blank, rugged moment. Mr. Higgins,
the senior surgeon, was left behind to tend the wounded.</p>

<p>The mass of the people of England is hasty, and often
unjust, in its judgment of military events. They will
condemn a General as rash when he advances, or revile
him as a coward when he retreats. News of the battle
of Talavera had been announced by the trumpet of
victory. The people of England expected the emancipation
of Spain. Now were they cast down when told that
the victors had been obliged to retire and leave their
wounded to the mercy of a vanquished enemy.</p>

<p>If Lord Wellington knew the strength and condition
of the force under Soult, it would be hard to justify his
conduct in facing back. In Spain, however, it was
impossible to get correct information. The Spaniards
are deaf to bad news and idiotically credulous to all
reports that flatter their hopes. Thus the rashness of
Lord Wellington in placing himself between two armies,
Soult and Ney, the least of whom was equal to himself,
may be palliated.</p>

<p>The repulse and flight of the French after the Battle of
Talavera restored confidence to the fugitive townsfolk.
They left the mountains and re-entered Talavera. The
house was again filled with old and young, who strove
to wait on the Captain. But soon the evacuation of the
town by the British awoke their fears; but with thankfulness
let us record that a British officer, wounded and
mutilated, was to the women of the house too sacred an
object to be abandoned.</p>

<p>The citizens of Talavera had clung to the hope that at
least their countrymen would stay and protect them;
but on the 4th, seeing them also file under their windows
in a long, receding array, they came to the Captain&mdash;those
near his house&mdash;beating their breasts and tearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
their hair, and demanded of him if he knew what was to
become of them.</p>

<p>Boothby sent Aaron to take a message to the Colonel
left Commandant by General Wellesley, but he came back
saying that the Colonel was gone, having given orders
that those in the hospitals who were able to move should
set off instantly for Oropesa, as the French were at hand.
The sensation this notice produced is beyond all description.
The Captain lay perfectly still; other wounded
men had themselves placed across horses and mules, and
fruitlessly attempted to escape. The road to Oropesa
was covered with our poor wounded, limping, bloodless
soldiers. On crutches or sticks they hobbled woefully
along. For the moment panic terror lent them a new force,
but many lay down on the road to take their last sleep.</p>

<p>Such were the tales that Aaron and others came to
tell him. He tried to comfort them, and said the French
were not so bad as they fancied. Still, his mind was far
from being at ease. He thought it possible that some
foraging party might plunder him and commit excesses
in the house, or on the women, who would run to him
for protection, however uselessly. The evening of the
4th, however, closed in quietness, and a visit from the
senior medical officer, Mr. Higgins, gave him great comfort.</p>

<p>The 5th of August dawned still and lovely. A traveller
might have supposed Talavera to be in profound peace
until, gazing on her gory heights, he saw they were covered
with heaps of ghastly slain. The tranquil interval was
employed in laying in a stock of provisions. Pedro
argued with him.</p>

<p>“But, signore, the Brencone asks a dollar a couple
for his chickens!”</p>

<p>“Buy, buy, buy!” was all the answer he could get
from the Captain.</p>

<p>Wine, eggs, and other provender were laid in at a rate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
which provoked the rage and remonstrance of the little
Italian servant.</p>

<p>About the middle of the day a violent running and
crying under the windows announced an alarm. The
women rushed into his room, exclaiming, “Los Franceses,
los Franceses!” The assistant surgeon of artillery
came in.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Steniland,” said the Captain, “are the
French coming?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered; “I believe so. Mr. Higgins is
gone out to meet them.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” said Boothby.</p>

<p>In about an hour Mr. Higgins entered, saying, “I
have been out of town above two leagues and can see
nothing of them. If they do come, they will have every
reason to treat us with attention, for they will find their
own wounded lying alongside of ours, provided with the
same comforts and the same care.”</p>

<p>On the 6th, reports of the enemy’s approach were
treated with total disregard. Between eight and nine
o’clock the galloping of horses was heard in the street.
The women ran to the windows and instantly shrank
back, pale as death, with finger on lip.</p>

<p>“Los demonios!” they whispered, and then on tiptoe
watched in breathless expectation of seeing some bloody
scene.</p>

<p>“They have swords and pistols all ready,” cried
Manoela, trembling.</p>

<p>“How’s this?” cried old Donna Pollonia. “Why,
they pass the English soldiers. They go on talking
and laughing. Jesus! Maria! What does it mean?”</p>

<p>Presently Mr. Higgins came in. He had ridden out to
meet the French General, and had found that officer full
of encomiums and good assurances.</p>

<p>“Your wounded are the most sacred trust to our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
national generosity. As for you, medical gentlemen,
who have been humane and manly enough not to desert
your duty to your patients (many of whom are Frenchmen),
stay amongst us as long as you please. You are as
free as the air you breathe.”</p>

<p>The town owed much to Mr. Higgins!</p>

<p>To prepare for the approaching crisis, to ride forth and
parley with the enemy and persuade him that he owes
you respect, gratitude&mdash;this is to be an officer of the first
class. Throughout Mr. Higgins displayed the character
of no common man.</p>

<p>We should say something of the household among
which the Captain was placed.</p>

<p>Servants and masters and mistresses in Spain associate
very freely together, but the submissive docility of the
servants keeps pace with the affability with which they
are treated. First after Don Manoel and Donna Pollonia
came Catalina&mdash;a tall, elegant woman of forty, a
sort of housekeeper held in high estimation by the señora.
Then come two old women, Tia Maria and Tia Pepa
“tia” means “aunt”); then Manoela, a lively, simple
lass, plain and hardy, capable of chastising with her fists
any ill-mannered youth. Then the carpenter’s daughters,
two pretty little girls, often came to play in his room&mdash;Martita,
aged about ten, and Maria Dolores, perhaps
fifteen, pensive, tender, full of feminine charm. These
fair sisters used to play about him with the familiarity
and gentleness of kittens, and lightened many an hour.</p>

<p>Well, it was not all plain sailing, for stories of pillage
and plunder came to their ears. Three troopers had gone
to the quarters of his wounded friend, Taylor, and began
coolly to rifle his portmanteau.</p>

<p>Taylor stormed and said he was an English Captain.</p>

<p>“Major, ’tis very possible,” said they; “but your
money, your watch, and your linen are never the worse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
for that; no, nor your wine either!” and the ruthless
savages swallowed the wine and the bread which had
been portioned out as his sustenance and comfort for the
day.</p>

<p>Feeling that such might be his case, Boothby put his
money and watch in a little earthen vessel and sent it
to be buried in the yard; then calling for his soup and a
large glass of claret, he tossed it off defiantly, saying
to himself, “You don’t get this, my boys!”</p>

<p>Next morning they heard that the French infantry
were coming, and the town was to be given up to pillage,
as so many of the citizens had deserted it.</p>

<p>The women came to him. “Shall we lock the street
door, Don Carlos?” they said.</p>

<p>“By all means,” said he. “Make it as fast as you
can, and don’t go near the windows.”</p>

<p>Soon they heard the bands playing, and the women
rushed to the windows, as if to see a raree-show, forgetting
all his injunctions.</p>

<p>Soon after thump! thump! thump! sounded at the
door.</p>

<p>“Virgin of my soul!” cried old Pollonia, tottering to
the window. “There they are!” But, peeping out
cautiously, she added, “No, ’tis but a neighbour. Open,
Pepa.”</p>

<p>“You had better not suffer your door to be opened at
all,” said the Captain.</p>

<p>But Pepa pulled the string, and in came the neighbour,
shrieking:</p>

<p>“Jesus! Maria! Dios Santissimo! The demons are
breaking open every door and plundering every house;
all the goods-chests&mdash;everything&mdash;dragged out into the
street.”</p>

<p>“Maria di mi alma! Oh, señora!”</p>

<p>The crashing of doors, breaking of windows, loud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
thumpings and clatterings, were now distinctly heard
in all directions. All outside seemed to boil in turmoil.</p>

<p>Ere long, thump! thump! at their own door.</p>

<p>But it was only another neighbour. Pepa pulled the
string, and in she came. Her head was piled up with
mattresses, blankets, quilts, and pillows. Under one
arm were gowns, caps, bonnets, and ribbons. Her other
hand held a child’s chair. Add to all this that her figure
was of a stunted and ludicrous character, and she came
in puffing and crying under that cumbrous weight of
furniture. They could not resist laughing.</p>

<p>“For the love of God, señora,” she whined, “let me
put these things in your house.”</p>

<p>She was shown up into the garret. Others followed
after her.</p>

<p>But soon there was a louder knocking, with a volley
of French oaths. The house shook under the blows.</p>

<p>“Pedro, tell them in French that this is the quarter
of an English Captain.”</p>

<p>Pedro cautiously peeped out of the window.</p>

<p>“Dios! there is but one,” said Pedro, “and he carries
no arms. Hallo, sair! la maison for Inglis Captin! Go
to hell!”</p>

<p>This strange language, and his abrupt, jabbering way
of talking, forced a laugh out of his master.</p>

<p>“Ouvrez la porte, bête!” shouted the Frenchman. “I
want some water.”</p>

<p>“Holy Virgin!” cried Pollonia. “We had better
open the door.”</p>

<p>“No, no, no!” said Boothby. “Tell him, Pedro,
that if he does not take himself off I shall report him to
his General.”</p>

<p>Pedro had not got half through this message, when
suddenly he ducked his head, and a great stone came in
and struck the opposite wall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>“Il demonio!” groaned the women, as they, too,
ducked their heads.</p>

<p>Then the fellow, who was drunk, just reeled off in
search of some easier adventure.</p>

<p>Pedro had hardly finished boasting of his victory when
the door was again assailed.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Pollonia, “it’s only two officers’ servants;”
and she shut the window.</p>

<p>“Well, what did they want?” asked the Captain.</p>

<p>“They wanted lodgings for their masters, but I told
them we had no room.”</p>

<p>“And have you room, Donna Pollonia?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but I didn’t choose to say so.”</p>

<p>“Run, Pedro, run and tell those servants that there
is plenty of room. Don’t you see, señora, that this is
the best chance of preserving your house from pillage?”</p>

<p>They returned&mdash;one a Prussian lad who spoke French
very ill. The Captain’s hope that these fellow-lodgers
would prove gentlemen lent him a feeling of security.</p>

<p>Little Pedro was watching the motions of the two
servants like a lynx.</p>

<p>“Signore,” said he, “those two <i>diavoli</i> are prying
about into every hole and corner.”</p>

<p>On this Aaron was sent to dig up the watch and money
and bring the wine upstairs.</p>

<p>Soon after in came Pedro, strutting with a most consequential
air.</p>

<p>“The French Captain, signore,” said he.</p>

<p>There followed him a fine, military-looking figure,
armed cap-à-pie, and covered with martial dust. He
advanced to the bedside with a quick step.</p>

<p>“I have had the misfortune, sir, to lose a limb,” said
Boothby, “and I claim your protection.”</p>

<p>“My protection!” he replied, putting out his hand.
“Command my devoted services! The name of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
Englishman in distress is sufficient to call forth our
tenderest attention.”</p>

<p>The Captain was a good deal affected by the kindness
of his manner. Kindness can never be thoroughly felt
unless it be greatly wanted.</p>

<p>He begged he would visit him sometimes, and he
promised to bring a friend.</p>

<p>Señora Pollonia was charmed with M. de la Platière,
who, with his young friend Captain Simon, often came
in for a chat.</p>

<p>Alas! they had to go away after a few days’ stay, but
de la Platière wrote his name in chalk on the door, in the
hope that it might discourage any plunderers.</p>

<p>One day Boothby was suddenly aroused by the appearance
in his room of an officer whom he had seen before,
but did not much like.</p>

<p>“Eh, Capitaine, comment ça va-t-il? Ça va mieux!
Ha! bon!”</p>

<p>Then he explained that the blade of his sword was
broken. “As prisoner of war,” he said, “you will have
no use for a sword. Give me yours, and, if you will,
keep mine. Where is yours?”</p>

<p>“It stands,” said Boothby, “in yonder corner. Take
it by all means.”</p>

<p>“Je vous laisserai la mienne,” he said, and hurried off.</p>

<p>Boothby wished his sword in the Frenchman’s gizzard,
he was so rough and rude.</p>

<p>One afternoon Pedro rushed in, excited, and said:
“The General himself is below, sir!”</p>

<p>“Bring him up, Pedro.”</p>

<p>Quickly he ushered in an officer of about the age of
five-and-thirty. He was splendidly dressed, of an
elegant person, his face beaming with good nature and
intelligence.</p>

<p>He came up to the bed, and without waiting for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
form of salutation, seated himself in a chair close to the
pillow, and laying his hand on Boothby’s arm, he said,
in a mild and agreeable voice:</p>

<p>“Ne vous dérangez, mon ami! Solely I am here to
see if I can possibly lighten a little the weight of your
misfortune. Tell me, can I be useful to you? Have you
everything you want?”</p>

<p>For all these kind inquiries the Captain expressed his
gratitude, and added, “I have really nothing to ask for,
unless you could send me to England.”</p>

<p>“Ah! if you were able to move, Captain, I could exchange
you now; but by the time you will have gained
strength to travel you will be at the disposal of the Major-General
of the army.”</p>

<p>That visit gave much comfort and hope.</p>

<p>In the evening de la Platière and Simon returned with
the news that Sir Arthur Wellesley had met with disasters.</p>

<p>“Taisez-vous, mon cher,” said Simon. “It may have
a bad effect on his spirits.”</p>

<p>But he insisted on hearing all they knew, and while
they were talking a French soldier walked calmly up
into the room, and coming up to the foot of the bed,
stood before his officers, astounded, petrified.</p>

<p>When, after sternly eyeing him a while, they sharply
demanded his business, his faculties returned, and he
stammered out:</p>

<p>“Mon Capitaine, I&mdash;I&mdash;I took it for a shop! I beg
pardon.” And off he went in a hurry. But what would
he have done if he had found the English officer alone?</p>

<p>On October 1 Captain Boothby was allowed to go out
on crutches. He says: “The sense of attracting general
observation hurried me. The French soldiers who met
me expressed surprise at seeing the success of an amputation
which in the hands of their field surgeons was nearly
always fatal. The Spaniards were most sympathizing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
‘What a pity!’ ‘So young, too!’ ‘Poor young Englishman!’
were pathetically passed along the street as he
hobbled by.”</p>

<p>In July, 1810, Captain Boothby was exchanged with
a French prisoner and returned to his father and mother
in England.</p>

<p>This gives us the kindlier side of war; but there is
another side.</p>

<p>In the prison of Toro were some French soldiers kept
by the Spaniards. Nothing could be worse than the
cruelty under which these Frenchmen suffered. In
their prison was a cell, with a window strongly barred,
and covered by an iron shutter pierced with small holes.
The dungeon was about 10 feet square and 5 feet high.
At the furthest end was a block of stone for a seat, with
an iron collar for the neck, fixed by a short chain in the
wall. Another chain was passed round the body. The
poor wretches were chained in one position all day,
which often hurried them to a miserable death. Their
food was a little bread and water.</p>

<p>It is easy, however, to bear any amount of suffering
when you know the time will soon come when you will
be free.</p>

<p>It is not so easy to bear a whole lifelong penalty for
having dared to fight for one’s country. One would
think that a national gratitude would rescue our wounded
soldiers from a life of beggary or the workhouse. Yet
after every war how many one-armed and one-legged
soldiers or sailors are pitifully begging along our streets
and roads!</p>

<p>There is no animal so cruel as man. <i>Corruptio optimi
pessima.</i></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />
<span class="smaller">THE CAPTURE OF CIUDAD RODRIGO (1812)</span></h2>

<p class="summary">A night march&mdash;Waiting for scaling-ladders&mdash;The assault&mdash;Ladders
break&mdash;Shells and grenades&mdash;A magazine explodes&mdash;Street fighting&mdash;Drink
brings disorder and plunder&mdash;Great spoil.</p>

<p>After Talavera Sir Arthur Wellesley became Lord Wellington;
he was opposed by Soult, Marmont, and Masséna.
On the 1st of January Wellington crossed the
Agueda, and advanced to the assault of Ciudad Rodrigo,
which had to be hurried on because Marmont was advancing
to its relief. Fortunately, we have descriptions
from more than one eyewitness of the siege. Ciudad
Rodrigo is built on rising ground, on the right bank of
the Agueda. The inner wall, 32 feet high, is without
flanks, and has weak parapets and narrow ramparts.
Without the town, at the distance of 300 yards, the
suburbs were enclosed by a weak earthen entrenchment,
hastily thrown up.</p>

<p>It was six o’clock on the evening of the 19th of January.
The firing on both sides had slackened, but not ceased.
The chiefs were all bustle and mystery. They had had
their instructions. Soon the 5th and 77th were ordered to
fall in, and halted on the extreme right of the division.
Whilst the men hammered at their flints the order was
read to the troops. They were to take twelve axes in
order to cut down the gate by which the ditch was entered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
The 5th Regiment were to have twelve scaling-ladders,
25 feet long, to scale the Fausse Brage, clear it of the
enemy, throw over any guns, and wait for General
M’Kinnon’s column in the main attack.</p>

<p>“Whilst waiting in the gloom for the return of the men
sent for the ladders, we mingled in groups of officers,
conversing and laughing together with that callous
thoughtlessness which marks the old campaigner.</p>

<p>“I well remember how poor McDougall of the 5th
was quizzed about his dandy moustaches. When next
I saw him, in a few short hours, he was a lifeless and a
naked corpse.</p>

<p>“Suddenly a horseman galloped heavily towards us.
It was Picton. He made a brief and inspiriting speech
to us&mdash;said he knew the 5th were men whom a severe
fire would not daunt, and that he reposed equal confidence
in the 77th. A few kind words to our commander
and he bade us God-speed, pounding the sides of his hog-maned
cob as he trotted off.”</p>

<p>Major Sturgeon and the ladders having arrived, the
troops again moved off about half-past six. The night
was rather dark, the stars lending but little light.</p>

<p>They were enjoined to observe the strictest silence.
It was a time of thrilling excitement as they wound
their way by the right, at first keeping a distance of
1,200 yards from the town, then bending in towards the
convent of Santa Cruz and the river. The awful stillness
of the hour was unbroken save by the soft, measured
tread of the little columns as they passed over the green
turf, or by the occasional report of a cannon from the
walls, and the rush and whizz of its ball as it flew past,
or striking short, bounded from the earth over their
heads, receiving, perhaps, most respectful, though involuntary,
salaams. Every two or three minutes a gun
was fired at some suspicious quarter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>They had approached the convent and pushed on
nearer the walls, which now loomed high and near. They
reached the low glacis, through which was discovered a
pass into the ditch, heavily palisaded with a gate in the
centre. Through the palisades were visible the dark
and lofty old Moorish walls, whilst high overhead was
the great keep or citadel, a massive square tower, which
looked like a giant frowning on the scene. The English
still were undiscovered, though they could distinguish
the arms of the men on the ramparts, as they fired in idle
bluster over their heads.</p>

<p>Eagerly, though silently, they all pressed towards the
palisades as the men with hatchets began to cut a way
through them. The sound of the blows would not have
been heard by the enemy, who were occupied by their
own noises, had it not been for the enthusiasm, so characteristic
of his country, which induced a newly-joined
ensign, fresh from the wilds of Kerry, to utter a tremendous
war-whoop as he saw the first paling fall before the
axes. The cheer was at once taken up by the men, and,
as they instantly got convincing proofs that they were
discovered&mdash;the men on the walls began to pepper them
soundly&mdash;they all rushed through the opening. In the
ditch the assailants were heavily fired on from rampart
and tower. The French tossed down lighted shells and
hand-grenades, which spun about hissing and fizzing
amongst their feet. Some of these smashed men’s
heads as they fell, whilst others, exploding on the ground,
tossed unlucky wretches into the air, tearing them
asunder. Seldom could any men have passed three or
four minutes more uncomfortably than the time which
was consumed in bringing in and fixing the ladders
against a wall, towards which they all crowded.</p>

<p>Amongst the first to mount was the gallant chieftain
of the 5th, but the love they bore him caused so many of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
the soldiers to follow on the same ladder that it broke in
two, and they all fell, many being hurt by the bayonets
of their own comrades round the foot of the ladder.</p>

<p>“I was not one of the last in ascending,” writes an
officer of the 77th, “and as I raised my head to the level
of the top of the wall, I beheld some of our fellows demolishing
a picket which had been stationed at that
spot, and had stood on the defensive.</p>

<p>“They had a good fire of wood to cheer themselves by,
and on revisiting the place in the morning, I saw their
dead bodies, stripped, strangely mingled with wounded
English officers and men, who had lain round the fire all
night, the fortune of war having made them acquainted
with strange bed-fellows.</p>

<p>“Our ascent of the ladders placed us in the Fausse
Brage&mdash;a broad, deep ditch&mdash;in which we were for the
moment free from danger.</p>

<p>“When about 150 men had mounted, we moved
forward at a rapid pace along this ditch, cowering close
to the wall, whilst overhead we heard the shouts and
cries of alarm. Our course was soon arrested by the
massive fragments and ruins of the main breach made
by our men, and here we were in extreme danger, for
instead of falling into the rear of a column supposed to
have already carried the breach, we stood alone at its
base, exposed to a tremendous fire of grape and musketry
from its defences.</p>

<p>“For a minute or two we seemed destined to be sacrificed
to some mistake as to the hour of attack, but suddenly
we heard a cheer from a body of men who flung
down bags of heather to break their fall, and leaped on
them into the ditch.</p>

<p>“It was the old Scots Brigade, which, like us, having
been intended as a support, was true to its time, and was
placed in the same predicament as we were.”</p>

<p class="header">The Night Assault of Ciudad Rodrigo</p>

<p>The enemy, immediately on discovering the presence of the British soldiers, commenced
firing and throwing lighted shells and hand grenades at them.</p></div>
</div>

<p>On the appearance of the 94th the fire of the garrison
was redoubled, but it was decided by the officers that it
was better to die like men on the breach than like dogs
in a ditch, and so, with a wild “Hurrah!” they all sprang
up, absolutely eating fire. The breach must have been
70 feet wide, and consisted of a nearly perpendicular
mass of loose rubbish, in which it was very difficult to
obtain a footing.</p>

<p>The enemy lost no time. They pointed two guns
downwards from the flanks and had time to fire several
rounds of grape, working fearful destruction on the
British. On the margin of the breach were ranged a
quantity of shells, which were lighted and rolled down
on them; but they acted rather as a stimulus to push
up, and so avoid their explosion. The top of the
breach was defended by a strong body of the garrison,
who maintained a heavy fire of musketry, and hurled
down hand-grenades and fire-balls. However, a night
attack, with all its defects, has the advantage of concealing
from the view much of danger and of difficulty
that, if seen, might shake the nerve.</p>

<p>But there was no time for hesitation, no choice for the
timid. The front ranks were forced onwards by the
pressure of those in the rear, and as men fell wounded on
the breach, there they lay, being trodden into and
covered by the shifting rubbish displaced by the feet of
their comrades. Some few, more lucky, when wounded
fell or rolled down the slope into the ditch, and they
added by their outcries to the wildness of the scene.
The enemy’s resistance slackened, and they suddenly
fled. Some guns they left behind in their panic.</p>

<p>It was now seven o’clock; the breach was carried, and
the town virtually ours. About that time a wooden
magazine placed on the rampart blew up, destroying our
General and many with him, as well as a number of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
garrison. Patterson of the 43rd and Uniacke of the
95th were of the number.</p>

<p>“I distinctly remember the moment of the explosion
and the short pause it occasioned in our proceedings&mdash;a
pause that enabled us to hear the noise of the attack
still going forward near the little breach. I met Uniacke
walking between two men. One of his eyes was blown
out, and the flesh was torn from his arms and legs.</p>

<p>“I asked who it was. He replied, ‘Uniacke,’ and
walked on.</p>

<p>“He had taken chocolate with our mess an hour before!</p>

<p>“At this time a gigantic young Irish volunteer attached
to our regiment, observing a gallant artilleryman still
lingering near his gun, dashed at him with bayonet fixed
and at the charge.</p>

<p>“The man stepped backwards, facing his foe; but his
foot slipping, he fell against the gun, and in a moment
the young Irish fellow’s bayonet was through his heart.
The yell with which he gave up the ghost so terrified B&mdash;&mdash;
that he started back, the implement of death in his hands,
and, apostrophizing it, said, ‘Holy Moses! how aisy you
went into him!’ This saying became celebrated afterwards
through the whole division.</p>

<p>“Colonel McLeod caused Lieutenant Madden of the
43rd to descend the small breach with twenty-five men,
to prevent soldiers leaving the town with plunder. At
eleven o’clock I went to see him. He had very judiciously
made a large fire, which, of course, showed up the plunderers
to perfection. He told me that no masquerade
could, in point of costume and grotesque figures, rival
the characters he stripped that night.”</p>

<p>Well, to go back to the storming party. The men who
lined the breastwork having fled, our men dropped from
the wall into the town and advanced in pursuit. At first
they were among ruins, but gradually made their way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
into a large street which led nearly in a straight line from
the principal breach to the <i>plaza</i>, or square. Up this
street they fought their way, the enemy slowly retiring
before them. At about half the length of the street was
a large open space on the left hand, where was deposited
the immense battering train of “the army of Portugal.”</p>

<p>Amongst this crowd of carriages a number of men
ensconced themselves, firing on the British as they
passed, and it required no small exertion on their part to
dislodge them. In the meantime many of the French
ahead of them had entered the square, for which place
our fellows pushed on with as many men as they could
lay hands on, formed without distinction of regiment,
into two or three platoons. For the great proportion of
the men who had started with the column had sneaked
off into the by-streets for the purpose of plundering&mdash;a
business which was already going on merrily.</p>

<p>As they reached the head of the street, which entered
the square at one angle, and wheeled to the left into the
open space, they received a shattering volley, which
quickly spoiled their array. The French were drawn up
in force under the colonnade of the cathedral, and we
were for the moment checked by their fire.</p>

<p>At length, when they were meditating a dash at the
fellows, they heard fire opened from another quarter,
which seemed to strike the French with a panic, for on
our men giving a cheer and running forward, they to a
man threw away their arms as if by word of command,
and vanished in the gloom like magic.</p>

<p>It was the Light Division who entered the square by
a street leading from the little breach, and their opportune
arrival had frightened away the game which had
been brought to bay, leaving the pavement of the square
littered with arms and accoutrements.</p>

<p>But now begins a part of the story which does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
reflect much credit on our fellows. When the men had
sipped the wine and brandy in the stores which they
plundered, most extreme disorders began, which it was
impossible to check. A whole division could not have
restored order.</p>

<p>Three or four large houses were on fire&mdash;two of them
were in the market-place&mdash;and the streets were illuminated
by the flames.</p>

<p>The soldiers were growing very drunk, and many of
them for amusement were firing from the windows into
the streets.</p>

<p>“I was myself talking to the barber Evans in the
square, when a ball passed through his head. This was
at one o’clock in the morning. He fell at my feet dead,
and his brains lay on the pavement. I then sought
shelter, and found Colonel McLeod with a few officers in
a large house, where we remained until the morning.</p>

<p>“I did not enter any other house in Ciudad Rodrigo.
If I had not seen it, I never could have supposed that
British soldiers would become so wild and furious.</p>

<p>“It was quite alarming to meet groups of them in the
streets, flushed as they were with drink, and desperate
in mischief, singing, yelling, dealing blows at man, woman,
or child like so many mad things loose from Bedlam.</p>

<p>“In the morning the scene was dismal and dreary.
The fires were just going out; all over street and square
were lying the corpses of many men who had met their
death hours after the town had been taken.</p>

<p>“At eleven o’clock I went to look at the great breach.
The ascent was not so steep as that of the small one, but
there was a traverse thrown up at each side of it on the
rampart. I counted ninety-three men of the Third
Division lying dead on the rampart between the traverses.
I did not see one dead man on the French side of those
traverses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>“I saw General McKinnon lying dead. He was on
his back just under the rampart. He had, I think,
rushed forward and fallen down the perpendicular wall,
probably at the moment of receiving his mortal wound.
He was stripped of everything except his shirt and blue
pantaloons; even his boots were taken off.</p>

<p>“There were no others dead near him, and he was not
on the French side either. It is said that he was blown
up, but I should say not. There was no appearance
indicating that such had been his fate. Neither his skin
nor the posture in which he was lying led me to suppose
it. When a man is blown up, his hands and face, I
should think, could not escape. McKinnon’s face was
pale and free from the marks of fire. How strange! but
with his exception I did not see a man of the Third
Division who had been stripped.”</p>

<p>Besides possession of the fortress, the whole of Masséna’s
battering-train had become prize, as well as an
immense quantity of light artillery which Marmont
brought against us on the retreat from El Boden.</p>

<p>The fortress was so well supplied with warlike stores
that not an article of any kind was wanting, in spite of
the great expenditure during the siege.</p>

<p>What would not the French and English say now?</p>

<p>Ciudad invested, bombarded, stormed, and taken in
twelve days! and this it cost Masséna fifty-one days to
do, sixteen of which he was bombarding the town. Every
part of the proceeding seems to have astonished the
garrison, as in erecting works, opening batteries, etc.,
they were always a day or two out in their calculations.</p>

<p>The George and Dragon had nearly disappeared from
the King’s colours by a shell passing through it, but “the
men were splendid” in attack, and followed their leaders
unto death.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE STORMING OF BADAJOS (1812)</span></h2>

<p class="summary">Rescue of wounded men&mdash;A forlorn hope&mdash;Fire-balls light up the
scene&mdash;A mine explodes&mdash;Partial failure of the English&mdash;Escalade
of the castle&mdash;Pat’s humour and heroism&mdash;Saving a General&mdash;Wellington
hears the news&mdash;The day after the storm.</p>

<p>Badajos is situated on the left bank of the Guadiana,
which is about 400 yards broad and washes one-fourth of
the enceinte. The defences along the river are confined
to a simple and badly flanked rampart, but on the other
sides there are eight large and well-built fronts with
covered way. The scarp of the bastions is more than
30 feet in height. In advance of these fronts are two
detached works, the Bardeleras and the Picurina, the latter
being a strong redoubt 400 yards from the town. As the
bombardment went on for some days, preparing a breach
for an assault, incidents were few; officers sometimes
strolled round to explore for themselves.</p>

<p>One writes: “One day I saw two men stretched on the
ground. One was dead, a round shot having passed
through his body; the other had lost a leg. His eyes
were closed; he seemed to be quite dead. An adventurous
Portuguese&mdash;one of our allies&mdash;was beginning to
disencumber him of his clothes.</p>

<p>“The poor man opened his eyes and looked in the
most imploring manner, while the villain had him by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
belt, lifting him up. I ran forward and gave the humane
Portuguese a sharp blow with my blunt sabre, so that
with a yell he threw himself down by the side of the
soldier whom he was stripping, thinking his last hour had
come.</p>

<p>“Soon after I saw a heavy shot hopping along and
kicking up the dust. It struck one of our soldiers on the
hip, and down he went, motionless.</p>

<p>“I felt confident that the wounded man was not dead,
and I begged that some of his comrades would carry him
off to the rear. They were retiring under a heavy
cannonade. Two soldiers, at the risk of their lives,
rushed back and brought him in, or he would have been
starved to death between our lines and the ramparts of
the town. His hip was only grazed and his clothes
untorn; but, of course, he was unable to walk, and seemed
to feel much pain, for he groaned heavily.</p>

<p>“Towards the end of the siege the weather became
beautiful. One day I call to mind the enemy scarcely
fired a shot. All our troubles were forgotten, and two or
three of us amused ourselves by reading a novel in the
trenches.”</p>

<p>The garrison of Badajos fired every morning for a few
days before the grand assault a certain number of rounds,
as if for practice and to measure the ground.</p>

<p>On the 6th of April a long order was issued relative to
the position the troops were to occupy. The day was
fine, and all the soldiers in good spirits, cleaning themselves
as if for a review.</p>

<p>“About two o’clock I saw poor Harvest. He was
sucking an orange and walking on a rising ground, alone
and very thoughtful. It gave me pain, as I knew he
was to lead the forlorn hope. He said, ‘My mind is
made up, old fellow: I am sure to be killed.’”</p>

<p>At half-past eight that night the ranks were formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
and the roll called in an undertone. The division drew
up in deep silence behind a large quarry, 300 yards from
the breaches. They had to wait long for ladders and
other things.</p>

<p>At ten a very beautiful fire-ball was thrown up from
the town. This illuminated the ground for many hundred
yards. Two or three more followed, showed a
bright light, and remained burning some little time.</p>

<p>The stillness that followed was the prelude to one of
the strangest scenes that could be seen. Soon after ten
a little whisper went round that the forlorn hope were
stealing forward, followed by the storming parties, composed
of 300 men.</p>

<p>In two minutes the division followed. One musket
shot (no more) was fired near the breaches by a French
soldier who was on the look-out. Still our men went
on, leisurely but silently. There were no obstacles. The
52nd, 43rd, and 95th closed gradually up to column of
quarter distance. All was hushed; the town lay buried
in gloom. The ladders were placed on the edge of the
ditch, when suddenly an awful explosion took place at
the foot of the breaches, and a burst of light disclosed
the whole scene. The very earth seemed to rock and
sway under their feet. What a sight!</p>

<p>The ramparts stood out clear, crowded with the enemy.
French soldiers stood on the parapets, while the short-lived
glare from the barrels of powder and stuff flying
into the air gave to friends and foes a look as if both bodies
of troops were laughing! A tremendous fire now opened
upon the English, and for an instant they were stationary;
but the troops were no ways daunted. The ladders were
found exactly opposite the centre breach, and the whole
division rushed to the assault with amazing resolution.
The soldiers flew down the ladders into the ditch, and the
cheering from both sides was loud and full of confidence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
Fire-balls were rising, lighting up the scene. The ditch
was very wide, and when they arrived at the foot of the
centre breach eighty or ninety men were clustered
together. One called out, “Who will lead?”</p>

<p>Death and the most dreadful sounds and cries encompassed
all. It was a volcano! Up they went:
some killed, others impaled on the bayonets of their
own comrades, or hurled headlong amongst the crowd.</p>

<p>The chevaux-de-frise atop looked like innumerable
bayonets.</p>

<p>“When I was within a yard of the top I felt half
strangled, and fell from a blow that deprived me of all
sensation. I only recollect feeling a soldier pulling me
out of the water, where so many men were drowned. I
lost my cap, but still held my sword. On recovering, I
looked towards the breach. It was shining and empty!
Fire-balls were in plenty, and the French troops, standing
upon the walls, were taunting us and inviting our
men to come up and try it again. What a crisis! what
a military misery! Some of the finest troops in the
world prostrate&mdash;humbled to the dust.”</p>

<p>Colonel McLeod was killed while trying to force the
left corner of the large breach. He received his mortal
wound when within three yards of the enemy. A few
moments before he fell he had been wounded in the back
by a bayonet of one of our men who had slipped. It was
found out afterwards that the woodwork of the cheval-de-frise
was heavy, bristling with short, stout sword-blades
and chained together. It was an obstacle not to
be removed, and the French soldiers stood close to it,
killing every man who drew near. To get past such
obstacles by living bodies pushing against it up a steep
breach, sinking to the knees every step in rubbish, while
a firm and obstinate enemy stood behind&mdash;it was impossible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>Round shot alone could have destroyed these defences,
which were all chained together and vastly strong. Had
it not been for this, the divisions would have entered
like a swarm of bees. It was fortunate that Lord Wellington
had made arrangements for assaulting the town
at other points.</p>

<p>“Next morning I was searching for my friend Madden.
At last I found him lying in a tent, with his trousers on
and his shirt off, covered with blood, and bandaged
across the body to support his broken shoulder, laid on
his back and unable to move. He asked for his brother.</p>

<p>“‘Why does he not come to see me?’</p>

<p>“I turned my head away, for his gallant young brother
was amongst the slain. Captain Merry, of the 52nd, was
sitting on the ground, sucking an orange.</p>

<p>“He said: ‘How are you? You see that I am dying:
a mortification has set in.’</p>

<p>“A grape-shot had shattered his knee. He had told
the doctor that he preferred death rather than permit
such a good leg to be amputated.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Escalade of the Castle.</span></h3>

<p>General Picton with the Third Division was ordered
to attack the castle by escalade. The castle was an old
building on the summit of a hill about 100 feet high, on
the north-east of the town.</p>

<p>At about ten o’clock on the night of the 6th of April,
1812, the Third Division advanced in that profound silence
that rendered the coming storm more terrific. Our men
were not perceived until they arrived at a little river not
very distant from the works, when they distinctly heard
the entire line of the French sentries give the alarm, and
all the guns of the garrison opened at once.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">

<p class="header">The Escalade of the Castle</p>

<p>Many of the ladders were too short. In one case a brawny Irish private of herculean
strength pulled up first his captain, “clever and clane,” as he said, and then five
others.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Volley after volley of grape-shot was fired upon our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
troops as they advanced; fire-balls rose, and showed
the enemy where they were. They quickened pace and
got so close under the wall that the guns could not bear
upon them, but the fire-balls burned so vividly that they
were enabled to direct their musketry upon the assailants,
and hurl with fatal precision every kind of missile.</p>

<p>The ladders were placed, the troops cheered and
swarmed up, and nothing was heard but mingled cries of
despair and shouts of victory. Several ladders broke
down under the weight, and men were precipitated on
the heads of their comrades below.</p>

<p>“The ladder I mounted was, like many others, too
short, and I found that no exertion I could make would
enable me to reach the embrasure or descend. In this
desperate state, expecting immediate death from the
hands of a ferocious Frenchman in the embrasure, I
heard a voice above call out:</p>

<p>“‘Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, is that you?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes!’ I shouted.</p>

<p>“The same voice cried out: ‘Oh, murther! murther!
What will we do to get you up at all, at all, with that
scrawdeen of a ladtherr? But here goes! Hould my
leg, Pat!’ and, throwing himself flat on his face in the
embrasure, he extended his brawny arm down the wall,
seized me by the collar with the force of Hercules, and
landed me, as he said himself, ‘clever and clane,’ on the
ramparts.</p>

<p>“In the same manner five more were landed. Thus
did this chivalrous soldier, with noble generosity, prefer
saving the lives of six of his comrades at the risk of his
own to the rich plunder which everywhere surrounded
him. And this was Tully O’Malley, a private in my
company, one of the ‘ragged rascals.’ Well, I found
myself standing amongst several French soldiers, who
were crowding round the gun in the embrasure. One of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
them still held the match lighted in his hand, the blue
flame of which gave the bronzed and sullen countenances
of these warriors an expression not easily forgotten.</p>

<p>“A Grenadier leaned on the gun and bled profusely
from the head; another, who had fallen on his knees
when wounded, remained fixed in astonishment and
terror. Others, whose muskets lay scattered on the
ground, folded their arms in deep despair. The appearance
of the whole group, with their huge, bushy moustaches
and mouths all blackened with biting the cartridges,
presented to the eye of a young soldier a very
strange and formidable appearance.</p>

<p>“‘Don’t mind them boys, sorr,’ said Tully. ‘They
were all settled jist afore you came up: and, by my soul,
good boys they were for a start&mdash;fought like raal divils,
they did, till Mr. S&mdash;&mdash; and the Grenadiers came powdering
down on them with the war-whoop. Och, my darlint!
they were made smiddreens of in a crack, barring that
big fellow you see there, with the great black whiskers&mdash;see
yonder&mdash;bleeding in the side, he is, and resting his
head on the gun-carriage. Ah! he was the bouldest
of them all. He made bloody battle with Jim Reilly;
but ’tis short he stood afore our Jim, for he gave him a
raal Waterford puck that tumbled him like a ninepin in
a minute; and, by my own sowl, a puck of the butt-end
of Jim’s piece is no joke, I tell you! He tried it on more
heads than one on the hill of Busaco.’</p>

<p>“Away then flew Tully to join his company, forming in
double-quick time to oppose the enemy, who were gathering
in force at one of the gates of the citadel.”</p>

<p>They had already opened a most galling fire of musketry
from this dark gateway, which was warmly returned by
our men, who, under Lieutenant Davern, charged up to
the massive gate. This, however, the French closed, so
little impression was made. At last a number of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
light infantry of the 74th and 85th helped each other to
climb up on the archway over the gate, and thence they
fired down so unexpectedly that a general panic seized
the enemy, and they fled in confusion, followed by many
of our men, who now dashed through the gateway.</p>

<p>Here Captain C&mdash;&mdash; came upon Major Murphy, of the
88th, quite exhausted and unable to move from loss of
blood, as he had not been able to bind up his wound.
This he did for him, and they moved on. One more
bayonet struggle in the castle, and the French again fled,
leaving the place literally covered with dead and wounded,
several of them being officers, whose long narrow-bladed
sabres with brass scabbards instantly changed masters.</p>

<p>One officer who was wounded made several thrusts at
the sturdy Ranger who was trying to disarm him, but had
awkwardly caught the sharp sword-blade in his hand, and
was so angry at being cut that he was preparing to rush
upon his antagonist. However, the Frenchman unbuckled
his waist-belt and threw away his sword.</p>

<p>But Pat was angry, and was not now satisfied with the
sword only, for, perceiving a handsome silver-mounted
calabash, or flask, by the officer’s side, he coolly transferred
it to his own shoulders, after first taking a copious
swill. Then, gravely addressing the wounded man, said,
while reloading his piece:</p>

<p>“Now, my tight fellow, ye see what ye lost by your
contrariness.”</p>

<p>“Ah! monsieur, je suis grievement blessé: rendez-moi
mon calabash, je vous prie.”</p>

<p>“Grieving for your calabash! Is that what you
mane?” said Pat. “Why, then, I’ll tell you what, my
boy: no man shall say that Pat Donovan ever deprived
either friend or foe of his little dhrop of dhrink&mdash;so there
’tis for you!”</p>

<p>“Grand merci! grand merci!” murmured the officer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, don’t bother about axing mercy from me,” said
Pat; “but take my advice and keep roaring out ‘Mercy!
mercy!’ to all our fellows as they come up to ye, and, by
Gor! they’ll not take the least notice of you.”</p>

<p>“Ah! merci! merci! Mais c’est fait de moi! c’est fait
de moi!” repeated the poor wounded young French
officer.</p>

<p>Fatal presentiment! One hour afterwards the Irishman
returned and found him lying on the same spot;
but the gallant fellow was at rest, “where the wicked cease
from troubling.”</p>

<p>As we were occupied in disarming and securing the
prisoners Captain C&mdash;&mdash; happened to capture and save
the life of the Colonel commanding the artillery in the
citadel at the very moment our men were pursuing him
at the point of the bayonet.</p>

<p>He threw himself upon the Captain, and finding he
understood French, entreated he would save him from
our infuriated soldiers; but this he found it extremely
difficult to do, as each successive group, on perceiving
his large gold epaulettes and orders, evinced a strong
anxiety to make further acquaintance with him. Upon
one occasion the Captain was obliged to use his sword to
protect him from a few of the 60th, who advanced upon
him in rather a suspicious and business-like manner.</p>

<p>The poor Colonel was in a state of violent agitation, and
kept a firm hold of his protector’s arm through all the
changes of the fight, until they met a field-officer of the
British artillery, to whom he gave him in charge.</p>

<p>The Frenchman wanted to bring C&mdash;&mdash; to the bomb-proof,
where his baggage was secured, to give him some
tokens of his gratitude, and overwhelmed him with
thanks; but duty called, and he left him with the field-officer,
who, he heard afterwards, reaped a rich reward
for his small service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>The first rays of a beautiful morning showed the
incredible strength of Badajos, and how dearly the
capture of it had cost us. The gallant hearts that beat
with devoted bravery the night before now lay in the cold
grasp of death. Silence had succeeded to the dreadful
din of arms, and rendered more awful the contemplation of
this fearful scene of death and suffering and desolation.</p>

<p>A vast number of the enemy lay dead in a heap close
by the spot where our men were forming, and while they
gazed on these unhappy victims of a fierce and deadly
fight, they were not a little astonished to observe a very
young French officer who lay amongst them, and whom
they thought to be dead also, slowly and cautiously raise
himself up; then, after looking about him with a wild
stare, he coolly walked over to the other side where the
prisoners were standing and delivered himself up!</p>

<p>This wily hero had not been wounded, nor had he received
the slightest scratch, but, being more frightened
than hurt, he lay concealed in this manner until all fear
of danger, as he thought, was over and gone.</p>

<p>It excited a good deal of merriment amongst our men,
but the French curled their moustaches, gave him a
hearty “Sacre!” and their deep contempt.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Another Account.</span></h3>

<p>“I was on a hill with the medical staff during the night
of the assault of Badajos. For two hours we watched
the fire, the bursting of shells and hand-grenades. Then
the wounded began to arrive, and we were busy.</p>

<p>“Lord Wellington rode up with his staff, and soon after
a staff-officer came up at a gallop, shouting, ‘Where is
Lord Wellington?’</p>

<p>“‘There, sir.’</p>

<p>“‘My lord, I am come from the breaches. The troops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
after repeated attempts, have failed to enter them. So
many officers have fallen that the men, dispersed in the
ditch, are without leaders. If your lordship does not at
once send a strong reinforcement they must abandon the
enterprise. Colonel McLeod, of the 43rd, has been killed
in the breach.’</p>

<p>“A light was called for and instantly brought, and Lord
Wellington noted the report with a steady hand. His
face was pale and expressed great anxiety. In his
manner and language he preserved perfect coolness and
self-possession. General Hay’s brigade was ordered to
advance to the breaches.</p>

<p>“You may think that it was nervous work hearing this.</p>

<p>“Our General had wisely planned two extreme attacks
by escalade on the castle by the Third Division and on the
south side of the town by the Fifth Division, and on Fort
Pardoleros by the Portuguese. It was known that Soult
was within a few leagues. Marmont had pushed his
advanced Dragoons as far as the bridge of boats at Villa
Velha; the river Guadiana was in our rear.</p>

<p>“It was a crisis, and we wondered what thoughts were
passing through the mind of our gallant chief as he sat
motionless on his horse.</p>

<p>“Presently another staff-officer galloped up, out of
breath.</p>

<p>“‘General Picton&mdash;has&mdash;got possession of&mdash;the castle,
sir.’</p>

<p>“‘Who brings that intelligence?’ exclaimed Lord
Wellington.</p>

<p>“The officer saluted and gave his name.</p>

<p>“‘Are you certain, sir&mdash;are you positively certain?’</p>

<p>“‘I entered the castle with the troops. I have only
just left it. General Picton in possession. He sent me.’</p>

<p>“‘Picton in possession! With how many men?’</p>

<p>“‘His division.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is impossible to describe to you the change this
news produced in the feelings of all around. A great
sigh of relief could almost be heard.</p>

<p>“‘Return, sir, and desire General Picton to maintain
his position at all hazards.’</p>

<p>“Having dispatched this messenger, Lord Wellington
directed a second officer to proceed to the castle to repeat
his orders to General Picton.</p>

<p>“Next morning at dawn I set out to visit the breaches.
I was just thinking of two friends, Major Singer and Captain
Cholwick, of the Royal Fusiliers, both of whom had
been with me two evenings before. I was wondering
how they had fared in the assault when I met some
Fusiliers and asked for Major Singer.</p>

<p>“‘We are throwing the last shovels of earth upon his
grave, sir.’</p>

<p>“‘Is Captain Cholwick safe?’ I inquired.</p>

<p>“‘In the act of climbing over that palisade he was
wounded, fell into the water, and we have seen nothing of
him since.’</p>

<p>“That did not make me disposed to be very cheerful.</p>

<p>“I found the great breach covered with dead from its
base to its summit. Many were stripped. Amongst
them I recognized the faces of many well known to me.
In climbing up the breach my feet receded at every step
in the débris, so as to make my progress slow and difficult.
Behind the chevaux-de-frise a broad and deep trench had
been cut, into which our men must have been precipitated
had they succeeded in surmounting this huge
barrier. Above was a battery of 12-pounders completely
enfilading the great and the small breach, near to each
other. No wonder we failed there to enter.</p>

<p>“I next visited the castle, at the bottom of whose
walls, nearly 40 feet high, were lying shattered ladders,
broken muskets, exploded shells, and the dead bodies of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
many of our brave men. Amongst the dead I recognized
the body of the gallant Major Ridge, of the 5th Regiment,
lying near the gate that leads to the town, in forcing which
he had fallen, riddled with balls.</p>

<p>“I met a soldier of the Connaught Rangers, overpowered
by excitement and brandy. The fellow looked
at me suspiciously, and appeared disposed to dispute my
passage. He held his loaded musket at half present, and
I was prepared to close with him; but fortunately flattery
succeeded. He allowed me to pass.</p>

<p>“Soon after entering the town a girl about nine years
of age implored my protection, ‘por el amor de Dios,’ for
her mother.</p>

<p>“A number of soldiers of a distinguished regiment were
in the house, armed, and under the influence of every evil
passion. Alas! I was powerless. I met a man of the
88th dragging a peasant by the neck, with the intention
of putting him to death&mdash;so he declared&mdash;in atonement for
his not having any money in his pockets! I appealed to
the gallantry of his corps, and saved the life of his victim.”</p>

<p>The town had now become a scene of plunder and
devastation. Our soldiers and our women, in a state of
intoxication, had lost all control over themselves. These,
together with numbers of Spaniards and Portuguese, who
had come into the city in search of plunder, filled every
street. Many were dispossessed of their booty by others,
and these interchanges of plunder in many cases were not
effected without bloodshed. Our soldiers had taken possession
of the shops, stationed themselves behind the
counters, and were selling the goods contained in them.
These were, again, displaced by more numerous parties,
who became shopkeepers in their turn, and thus continual
scuffling and bloodshed was going on.</p>

<p>In addition to the incessant firing through the keyholes
of the front doors of houses as the readiest way of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
forcing the locks, a desultory and wanton discharge of
musketry was kept up in the streets, placing all who
passed literally between cross-fires. Many of our own
people were thus killed or wounded by their own comrades.</p>

<p>An attempt was made next day to collect our soldiers.
The troops, however, that were sent into the town for
that purpose joined in the work of plunder.</p>

<p>We may feel shocked at the excesses which our soldiers
committed after the storming of such towns as Ciudad
Rodrigo and Badajos. Folk sitting by their quiet firesides
may wonder how sane men can be so dead to the
higher and better feelings of humanity; but when the
fever of war is followed by the poison of drink, it is no
wonder if the minds of rude men are thrown off their
balance. War is a most awful thing to witness, and many
officers have declared to the writer that, had they known
what war meant in all its dreadful reality, they would
not have been so eager in their youth to join the army.
All the more reason is there that every youth in our
islands should be compelled by law to learn the use of
the rifle, that when the time comes&mdash;as come it will&mdash;when
an invader shall set foot upon our shore, we may
not be helpless and unarmed. Perhaps it is necessary
that we should sometimes hear the horrid truth about
war; we may thus be stimulated to use a little self-denial
for our country’s security, when we realize that life is
not made up of games and money-making, and when we
can see what our fatherland would be to us, devastated
by a savage enemy, with farms and barns blazing, women
and children starved to death, towns sacked and plundered,
and the honour of old England trodden beneath
the foot of a foreign invader. The story of these sieges
has many lessons&mdash;military, ethical, and economic. Let
us at least learn one&mdash;the duty that is incumbent upon all
of us, men and boys, to defend mother and wife and child.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
<span class="smaller">A PRISONER IN ST. SEBASTIAN (1813)</span></h2>

<p class="summary">The <i>coup de grâce</i>&mdash;The hospital&mdash;A cruel order&mdash;An attempt at
escape&mdash;Removed to the castle&mdash;The English at the breach&mdash;Many
are wounded&mdash;French ladies sleep in the open&mdash;A vertical
fire&mdash;English gunners shoot too well&mdash;A good sabre lightly won.</p>

<p>Colonel Harvey Jones, R.E., has left us an interesting
account of the siege of St. Sebastian by the British forces.
The town, situated close to the French frontier, just
south of the Pyrenees and by the sea, contains 10,000
inhabitants, and is built on a low peninsula running
north and south. The defences of the western side are
washed by the sea, those on the eastern side by the river
Urumea, which at high-water covers 4 feet of the
masonry of the scarp. The first assault in July failed.
Colonel Jones was wounded and taken prisoner.</p>

<p>His diary begins: “After witnessing the unsuccessful
attempts of Lieutenant Campbell, 9th Regiment, and
his gallant little band to force their way on to the ramparts,
and their retreat from the breach, my attention
was soon aroused by a cry from the soldier who was
lying disabled next to me:</p>

<p>“‘Oh, they are murdering us all!’</p>

<p>“Looking up, I perceived a number of French Grenadiers,
under a heavy fire of grape, sword in hand, stepping
over the dead and stabbing the wounded. My companion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
was treated in the same manner. The sword, plucked
from his body and reeking with his blood, was raised to
give me the <i>coup de grâce</i>, when, fortunately, the uplifted
arm was arrested by a smart little man&mdash;a sergeant&mdash;who
cried out:</p>

<p>“‘Oh, mon Colonel, êtes-vous blessé?’ and he ordered
some men to remove me.”</p>

<p>They raised the Colonel in their arms and carried him
up the breach on to the ramparts. Here they were
stopped by a Captain of the Grenadiers, who asked some
questions, then kissed him, and desired the party to proceed
to the hospital.</p>

<p>They met the Governor and his staff on the way, who
asked if the Colonel was badly wounded, and directed
that proper care should be taken of him.</p>

<p>After descending from the rampart into the town, as
they were going along the street leading to the hospital,
they were accosted by an officer who had evidently taken
his “drop.” He demanded the Englishman’s sword,
which was still hanging by his side.</p>

<p>The reply came: “You have the power to take it, but
certainly have no right to do so, as I have not been made
a prisoner by you.”</p>

<p>This seemed to enrage him, and with great violence of
manner and gesture he unbuckled the belt and carried
away the sword.</p>

<p>Upon reaching the hospital, the Surgeon-Major was
very kind in his manner. After he had enlarged the
wounds, according to the French system, and then dressed
them, the Colonel was carried across the street and put
into a bed in one of the wards of the great hospital,
which a soldier was ordered to vacate for his use.
This man returned later in the day for his pipe and
tobacco, which he had left under the pillow.</p>

<p>In the course of the morning they were visited by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
Governor, who made inquiries as to their wounds, and
whether they had been plundered of anything; for a
great number of English soldiers had been taken, and
were lodged in the town prison. The only persons permitted
to visit them were some staff-officers, a few
Spanish ladies, and a Spanish barber. From the former
the Colonel was made acquainted with all that passed in
the British lines&mdash;at least, as far as the French could conjecture.
Although boats arrived nightly from Bayonne,
the other side of the frontier, bringing shells, medicine,
charpie, or lint, engineers, etc., the garrison remained
in great ignorance of the movements of the two armies.
Soult kept sending word that he would soon come and
raise the siege; thus, by promises of immediate relief,
he kept up the spirits of the garrison. He also rewarded
the gallantry of particular defenders during the assault
and in the sorties by promotion, or by sending them the
decoration of the Legion of Honour. In the French Army
there seemed to have been a system of reward for good
and gallant conduct by promotion into the Grenadiers
or Voltigeurs, which had an excellent effect. A French
soldier was extremely proud of his green, yellow, or
red epaulettes. They were badges of distinguished
conduct and only those who had shown great gallantry
in action were admitted into their ranks. What with
the success attendant upon the sorties and the
numerous decorations which had been distributed
among the officers and privates, such a spirit of daring
had been created that the idea of a surrender was
scouted by all.</p>

<p>After the stones had been extracted which had been
blown into his leg and thighs by the bursting of shells
and grenades, the Colonel was enabled to move about
and get into the gallery running round the courtyard of
the hospital, and into which all the doors and windows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
of the rooms respectively opened. It was the only place
where they were allowed to breathe the fresh air.</p>

<p>One day, whilst sitting in the gallery, he observed a
table placed in the balcony below him, on the other side
of the courtyard. Soon he saw an unfortunate French
gunner laid upon the table. They amputated both his
arms, his hands having been blown off by an accident in
one of the batteries. In the course of the morning, whilst
conversing with the surgeon who had performed the
operation, he told the Colonel that he had acted contrary
to his instructions, which were never to amputate, but
to cure if possible. When he was asked for the reason
of such an inhuman order having been issued, his reply
was that the Emperor Napoleon did not wish numbers
of mutilated men to be sent back to France, as it would
make a bad impression upon the people.</p>

<p>“You must be a bold man to act in opposition to this
order.”</p>

<p>He replied: “Affairs are beginning to change, and,
moreover, it is now necessary that the soldiers should
know they will be taken proper care of in the event of
being wounded, and not left to die like dogs. We send
as many as we can at night to Bayonne by the boats;
thus we clear out the hospitals a little.”</p>

<p>In conversations with many of the officers they detailed
acts committed by their soldiers in Spain so revolting
to human nature that one refuses to commit them to
paper. A <i>chef de bataillon</i> once asked him how the
English managed with their soldiers when they wanted
them to advance and attack an enemy.</p>

<p>The reply was simply, “Forward!”</p>

<p>“Ah! that way will not do with us. We are obliged
to excite our men with spirits, or to work upon their
feelings by some animating address; and very often,
when I have fancied I had brought them up to the fighting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
pitch, some old hand would make a remark which in an
instant spoilt all I had said, and I had to begin my speech
all over again.”</p>

<p>The Colonel asked how they managed to provision
their men when they went out on expeditions that lasted
ten or twenty days.</p>

<p>The answer was: “Our biscuits are made with a hole
in the centre. Each biscuit is the ration for a day.
Sometimes twenty are delivered to each soldier, who is
given to understand that he has no further claim on the
commisariat for those days.”</p>

<p>“But it is impossible for the soldier to carry twenty.”</p>

<p>“We know that very well, but he has no claim; and
how he lives in the meanwhile we do not ask. Perhaps
he lives on the country.” In other words, he steals!</p>

<p>In the hospital he was attended by a Spanish barber.
As he could speak Spanish fluently, they had a good deal
of talk. The barber used to tell all he heard and saw of
what was passing both inside and outside the fortress.
When he learnt that the Colonel was an engineer, he
offered to bring him a plan of all the underground drains
and of the aqueduct.</p>

<p>The attendant, although a good-natured man, kept a
sharp eye on the barber; so it was a difficult matter for
him to give anything without being detected.</p>

<p>At last, one morning when preparing to shave him, he
succeeded in shoving a plan under the bedclothes. The
Colonel seized the earliest opportunity of examining it,
and from the knowledge he had before acquired of the
place he soon mastered the directions of the drains, etc.
From that moment his whole attention was fixed on the
means of making his escape.</p>

<p>He knew that the hospital was situated in the principal
street, the ends of which terminated upon the fortifications
bounding the harbour. If once he could gain the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
street he had only to turn to the right or left to gain the
ramparts, and so make his escape from the town in the
best manner he could.</p>

<p>One evening just at dusk, when the medical men took
leave of them for the night, one of them left his cocked
hat on the bed. As soon as the Colonel noticed this he
put it on his head, hurried downstairs, and made direct
for the great door; but he found it so completely blocked
up by the guard that, unless by pushing them aside, it
was not possible to pass undiscovered. He therefore
retreated upstairs in despair, and threw the hat down
on the bed. Scarcely had he done so when in rushed the
doctor, asking for his <i>chapeau</i>.</p>

<p>They were more than once visited by the crews of the
boats which arrived nightly from France. The sight of
the prisoners seemed to afford the Frenchmen great
gratification, but there was nothing in their manner
which could in any way offend.</p>

<p>Very unexpectedly one evening the Governor’s aide-de-camp
came to the prison and told the officers to prepare
immediately to go to France.</p>

<p>A Portuguese Captain, one of the party of prisoners,
was dreadfully in fear of being sent there, and with
great warmth of manner told the aide-de-camp that Lord
Wellington would soon be in possession of the place, and
if the prisoners were not forthcoming he would hold the
Governor answerable in person.</p>

<p>It is supposed that the aide went and reported this
conversation to the Governor, as he did not return for
some time, and then told them it was too late to embark
that night, as the boats had sailed. They were never
afterwards threatened to be sent away.</p>

<p>About the middle of August the garrison began to
flatter themselves that the siege was turned into a regular
blockade, and that they would be relieved by the suc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>cesses
of Marshal Soult. Their spirits ran high, their
hopes were elated.</p>

<p>The 15th of August, the birthday of Napoleon, was
observed as a day of rejoicing among the garrison, and at
nightfall the letter “N” of a very large size was brilliantly
lighted up on the face of the donjon.</p>

<p>When the operations of the second siege began a
Captain who visited the Colonel kept him <i>au fait</i> of all
that was going on. One day a Spanish Captain who had
sided with the French came into the hospital&mdash;it was
on the evening of the assault. He was wringing his
hands, tearing his hair, and swearing he had heard the
shrieks of his wife and daughters, and had seen his house
in flames. The French officers took the poor man’s
outcries with great merriment, and the Spaniard must
have bitterly regretted the day when he deserted the
English. The French officers did not fail to taunt
him with having done so, and ridiculed his frantic
actions.</p>

<p>In the course of the next day Colonel Jones was asked
if he would like to speak with a corporal of sappers who
had been made prisoner during the sortie.</p>

<p>To his surprise, a fine, tall youngster, a stranger to
him, walked into the ward, dressed in a red jacket. Now,
blue was the colour when the Colonel was taken prisoner.</p>

<p>“When did you join the army, corporal?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yesterday morning, Colonel. I was put on duty in
the trenches last night, and in a few minutes I was
brought into the town by the enemy.”</p>

<p>“I could not help laughing, though he wore a rueful
expression,” says the Colonel.</p>

<p>One morning a Captain of artillery, whom he had never
before seen, came into the ward and commenced conversing
about the siege. He observed that the whole
second parallel of the British trenches was one entire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
battery, and if there were as many guns as there were
embrasures, he said, “we shall be <i>joliment fouettés</i>.”</p>

<p>The Colonel’s reply was: “Most assuredly you will.
Depend upon it, there are as many guns as embrasures.
It is not our fashion to make batteries and stick logs of
wood into the embrasures in the hope of frightening the
enemy.”</p>

<p>He made a grimace, and with a shrug of the shoulders
left the ward.</p>

<p>Next morning the surgeon came, as usual, to dress the
wounds. This was about half-past seven. All was still,
and he joyously exclaimed, as he entered:</p>

<p>“So, gentlemen, we have another day’s reprieve!”</p>

<p>In about half an hour afterwards, whilst Colonel Jones
was under his hands, the first salvo from the breaching
batteries was fired. Several shot rattled through the
hospital and disturbed the tranquillity of the inmates.
The instrument dropped from the surgeon’s hands, and he
exclaimed, “Le jeu sera bientôt fini!” Then very composedly
the good doctor went on with his work.</p>

<p>The opening of the batteries made a great stir amongst
all hands. A hint was given the prisoners to prepare to
be removed into the castle. A private hint was given to
the Colonel to be <i>sage</i> on the way up, as the Captain of
the escort was <i>méchant</i>, and that it would be better to
be quiet and orderly.</p>

<p>This, perhaps, was intended to deter any of them from
attempting to escape. The wounded prisoners were
moved in one body up the face of the hill to the entrance
of the castle. Under the Mirador battery they were
exposed to a sharp musketry fire. Some of the party were
wounded, the Portuguese Captain severely.</p>

<p>A building on the sea-side, which had been constructed
for a powder magazine, was now converted into their
hospital, the interior being fitted up with wooden beds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
In the area surrounding the building were placed the
unwounded prisoners. As the number of wounded from
the ramparts increased, the hospital filled rapidly, and
to prevent the fire from the English batteries being
directed upon them some of the prisoners were desired to
hoist a black flag on the roof. While they were doing so
the Colonel told the French officer that it was labour in
vain, as the British had learnt that this building was
their great depot for powder, and so hoisting a flag would
be regarded as a ruse to preserve their ammunition.
Little benefit did they get from the ensign. After the
capture of the island Santa Clara, hardly could anyone
move about that part of the castle opposite to the island
without the risk of being hit. Grape and shrapnel
swept the whole of the face, and it was only at night
that fresh water could be fetched from the tank.</p>

<p>The garrison had a fixed idea that the assault would
take place at night, so each morning they rose with happy
faces&mdash;another twenty-four hours’ reprieve!</p>

<p>On the 31st of August, when the first rattle of musketry
was heard in the castle, an inquiring look pervaded each
countenance; but no one spoke. As the firing continued
and the rattle grew and grew, little doubt remained
as to the cause. Every soldier seized his musket
and hurried with haste to his post. The Colonel was then
ordered not to speak or hold converse with the unwounded
prisoners outside. One French officer asked him if he
thought that the English prisoners would remain quiet
if an assault of the breach should take place, adding, “If
they were to make any attempt they would all be shot.”</p>

<p>Colonel Jones replied: “Do not fancy you have a flock
of sheep penned within these walls. Happen what may,
shoot us or not, you will be required to give a satisfactory
account of us when the castle is taken.”</p>

<p>From the commencement of the assault until the rush<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
into the castle upon the capture of the town, not the
slightest information could they obtain as to the state
of affairs at the breach. The period that intervened was
to the prisoners one of the most anxious and painful suspense.
At last the tale was told by the awful spectacle
of the interior of the hospital.</p>

<p>In an instant the ward was crowded with the maimed
and wounded. The amputation-table was in full play,
and until nearly daylight the following morning the
surgeons were unceasingly at work.</p>

<p>To have such a scene passing at the foot of one’s bed
was painful enough. Added to this the agonizing shrieks
and groans and the appearance of the sappers and Grenadiers
who had been blown up by the explosion in the
breach, their uniforms nearly burnt off, and their skins
blackened and scorched by gunpowder&mdash;all this was truly
appalling. The appearance of these men resembled anything
but human beings. Death soon put an end to their
sufferings, and relieved all from these most distressing
sights. Of all wounds, whether of fractured limbs or
otherwise, those caused by burns from gunpowder seemed
to produce the most excruciating pain.</p>

<p>In the rear of the donjon was a small building, in which
was stored much gunpowder. Shells were falling fast
and thick around it, so a detachment of soldiers was sent
to withdraw the ammunition. This dangerous service
they were performing in a most gallant manner, and had
nearly completed their work, when some shells fell into
the building, exploded the barrels that remained, and
blew the building, with some of the soldiers, into the air,
not leaving a vestige to show that such an edifice had
stood there.</p>

<p>There were three French ladies in the garrison. They
were on their way to France when the investment took
place. These ladies were permitted to enter the hos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>pital,
and were allowed a small space at one end of the
wooden bedsteads. There they were for several days
and nights. The only water they could obtain to wash
in was sea-water. As the number of the wounded increased,
some of the officers who were lying upon the
floor were loud in their complaints that madame and her
daughters were occupying the space which properly
belonged to them. They succeeded in getting the ladies
turned out, to find shelter from shot and shell where best
they could!</p>

<p>The day the castle capitulated Colonel Jones went in
search of his fair companions, and found them, nearly
smoke-dried, under a small projecting rock.</p>

<p>One of the young ladies was extremely pretty. Shortly
after the siege she was married to the English Commissary
appointed to attend upon the garrison until sent to
England. The change from the hospital to the naked
rock relieved them from witnessing many a painful scene,
as the amputating-table was placed near their end of the
ward.</p>

<p>After the capture of the town a heavy bombardment
of the castle took place, by salvos of shells from more than
sixty pieces of artillery. There were only a few seconds
between the noise made by the discharge of the mortars
and the descent of the shells. Those of the mutilated
who were fortunate enough to snatch a little sleep and so
forget their sufferings were awakened by the crash of
ten or a dozen shells falling upon or in the building, whose
fuses threw a lurid light through the gloom. The silence
within, unbroken save by the hissing of the burning
composition, the agonized feelings of the wounded
during those few moments of suspense, are not to be
described. Many an unlucky soldier was brought to the
table to undergo a second operation. The wretched
surgeons were engaged nearly the entire night. Rest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
was impossible. You could not choose but hear. The
legs and arms were thrown out as soon as amputated,
and fell on the rooks.</p>

<p>It was not an agreeable sight. Those who vote for
war do not realize these little details in the programme.
War, they say, breeds heroes.</p>

<p>It is but justice to the French medical officers to state
that their conduct during the whole period of their
harassing and laborious duties was marked by the greatest
feeling and kindness of manner, as well as by skilful
attention to the relief of all who came under their hands.</p>

<p>The unfortunate prisoners who were not wounded had
been placed in the area round the hospital, and being
without cover, suffered at every discharge.</p>

<p>The Colonel exerted himself to obtain a few pickaxes
and shovels to throw up some sort of splinter-proof, but
it was in vain he pleaded, and in the end fifty were killed
or wounded out of 150.</p>

<p>From the surgeons and hospital attendants they experienced
great kindness. Their diet was the same as
that of the French wounded soldiers. Their greatest
luxury was three stewed prunes!</p>

<p>The effects of the vertical fire on the interior of the
castle were so destructive that, had it been continued
six hours longer, the garrison would have doubtless surrendered
at discretion. They had lost all hope that
Soult could relieve them.</p>

<p>Everybody now sought shelter where best he could
among the rocks. Still, no nook or corner appeared to
be a protection from the shrapnel shells.</p>

<p>A sergeant of the Royals, standing at the foot of a
bedstead, was struck by a ball from a shrapnel shell,
and fell dead while talking. An Italian soldier, while
trying to prepare some broth for dinner, was blown into
the air&mdash;soup, bowl, and all!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>The excellence of the British artillery is well known.
Nothing could surpass the precision with which the
shells were thrown or the accuracy with which the fuses
were cut. During the siege our men in the British trenches
little heeded the lazy French shells which were thrown
into our batteries. From the length of the fuses sufficient
time was often allowed before they burst to put themselves
under cover; and when they did burst, the splinters
flew lazily around. But when the sound of an English
shell was heard in the castle, or when the men stationed
in the donjon cried, “Garde la bombe!” everybody was
on the alert. Touching the ground and bursting were
almost simultaneous, and the havoc from the splinters
was terrible. It appeared to be of little avail where a
man hid himself: no place was secure from them.</p>

<p>A French officer of Engineers, who was very badly
wounded, kindly lent the Colonel some of the professional
books which were supplied to him. Many were works
which he had never been able to procure. Much pleasure
and instruction did he derive from their perusal. He
found out that the French Engineers were supplied
with them by the Government, and their Generals also
with the best maps of the country.</p>

<p>One day the Colonel was called to the door of the ward
by a French officer, who exclaimed, as he pointed to a large
convoy of English transports coming in under full sail:
“Voilà les fiacres qui viennent nous chercher!” (“There
are the cabs coming to fetch us.”) It was a most cheering
and beautiful sight&mdash;the cabs that were sent to fetch
us home!</p>

<p>When Colonel Jones was told, shortly after, that he
was no longer a prisoner, he began to look round for the
best sword in the castle to replace the one which that rude
French Captain had taken from him.</p>

<p>He discovered a handsome sabre belonging to a wounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
staff-officer, so he sent and desired that it might be taken
down from the place where it was hanging, as he wanted
such a weapon.</p>

<p>“I have it still by me. It was the only sword I wore
until the end of the war, and often, when at the outposts
with a flag of truce, have I seen the French officers
regard the eagles on the belt with anything but a gratified
look.</p>

<p>“In 1815 I was quartered at Paris, being engineer in
charge of the fortifications on Mont-Martre. There I
frequently saw several of the St. Sebastian officers, and
from my old friend the Chirurgien-Major I received many
visits.</p>

<p>“We both agreed that, though the tables were turned,
our present position was far more agreeable than when
our acquaintance began in St. Sebastian.”</p>

news&mdash;A queer noise&mdash;A ruse that did not succeed&mdash;The

<p>In November, 1841, the English Resident at the Afghan
Court of Cabul was treacherously assassinated. General
Elphinstone, who was left in command of the English
troops, being in feeble health, attempted to leave the
country with his 4,500 troops and three times that
number of camp followers. On the 11th of March, 1842,
Akbar Khan with a large army attacked General Sale
at Jellalabad.</p>

<p>Jellalabad is a walled town on the right bank of the
Cabul River. The upper end of the valley is very
fertile and picturesque, studded with forts and villages,
but all round the city it is sandy and arid. Snow mountains
close in the valley on all sides.</p>

<p>South of Jellalabad, at a distance of 1,200 yards, is
a low range of limestone hills, and on the south-west
other low hills command the town at 200 yards’ distance.
All round the walls were houses, mosques, old forts,
gardens, and trees&mdash;in fact, every species of cover that
an enemy could desire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>The walls of the town were 2,100 yards in extent, all
in ruinous condition, and in many places not more than
9 feet high, and easily scaled. Through breaches in the
wall laden cattle and droves of asses went in and out
daily.</p>

<p>Into this town on the evening of the 12th of November,
1841, wearied, footsore, hungry, short of ammunition,
Sale’s brigade entered, to undertake the desperate task
of defending it against the whole power of the country,
the people of which not only hated us as invaders, but
regarded us as infidels to be rooted out.</p>

<p>At a distance of 600 miles from our own frontier, with
the formidable defiles of the Khyber Pass to cross, what
would be our condition if Runjeet Sing should refuse to
allow another army to traverse his territories?</p>

<p>In the meantime these ruinous walls were better than
the open plain; so, after viewing the fortifications, Sale
marched the brigade in, and the inhabitants fled out at
the other side as we entered.</p>

<p>It was decided to hold the whole town and try to make
it defensible. Our supply of provisions was so low that
the troops had to be put on half, and the camp followers
on quarter, rations. As to ammunition, we had only
120 rounds per man. We set to work and collected grain,
flour, pulse, and food of all sorts which had been left
behind, and in a few hours supplies for several days had
been gathered in.</p>

<p>As parts of the walls had no parapets and the sentries
were quite exposed, hundreds of camel saddles were
ranged, two deep and two high, for the sentries to kneel
behind.</p>

<p>The next day many thousands of the enemy came
swarming round and set fire to the grass huts and sheds
on the eastern side. Some of them seemed to be bent on
getting into a small mosque near the town, so a party of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
sappers, under Major Broadfoot, were sent to see what it
contained.</p>

<p>They discovered a quantity of carbine ammunition,
which proved to our men a timely and welcome supply.
From dusk till midnight they kept firing on our sentries
with wild yells. Then they withdrew, and the troops
could snatch some rest.</p>

<p>At early dawn Sale determined on a sortie, and all were
aroused without sound of bugle. Seven hundred infantry
and two guns, commanded by Colonel Monteath, were
ordered to sally out at sunrise and attack the Afghans.
There were some 6,000 Afghans waiting to meet them
in the rocky hills at the south-west angle of the city, but
they did not resist long, and the cavalry rolled them over
and pursued the fugitives, while Abbot’s guns ploughed
through them wherever they massed together.</p>

<p>By ten o’clock it was all over. The panic was so
great that they deserted the forts, and we secured all
the grain and fodder.</p>

<p>Two great results followed this fortunate victory: it
gave the garrison a little breathing-time, and we had a
few days of uninterrupted quiet to repair our walls and
destroy cover.</p>

<p>The people of the valley now adopted the usual Oriental
policy of trying to keep well with both parties, and sent
in donkey-loads of flour, wheat, etc.</p>

<p>Working parties were told off to clear away the rubbish,
to destroy houses outside, and to build parapets on the
walls; for with the enemy’s marksmen so near, no one
could look over the walls or show a cap without getting
a shot through it.</p>

<p>“Jellalabad” means “the abode of splendour,” but
our men found it squalid and mean. There were two
main streets, crossing each other at right angles; the rest
were narrow, filthy lanes. The mountain tribes have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
fair complexions and the Grecian type of face. They
are believed to be the descendants of the Greeks left by
Alexander the Great. All their implements and household
utensils are totally different from those used by the
Afghans.</p>

<p>As soon as the enemy was driven off by our sortie the
troops set to work on the defences. No one was allowed
to be idle. Officers and men, with spade, pickaxe, bill-hook,
or mining tools in hand&mdash;all were at work from
daybreak to sunset.</p>

<p>Parties of the enemy hovered about, but never dared
to molest us. Strong detachments of cavalry were sent
out every day to protect our grass-cutters.</p>

<p>On the 21st of November the garrison received bad
news. The little fort of Pesh Bolak (half-way between
Jellalabad and the Khyber) had had to be evacuated,
and Captain Ferris had been seen going over the mountains
away to Peshawar in hasty retreat.</p>

<p>Then from Cabul they heard that our troops there
were shut up by the insurgents in their fortified cantonment,
that there was a general rising of the whole country,
and the roads were closed against messengers.</p>

<p>Every night now parties of the enemy used to creep
round and fire at our sentries. At twelve o’clock on the
night of the 28th there was a tremendous report, like the
firing of a heavy gun. The alarm was sounded, and in
two minutes every man was at his post. Seaton was
Captain of the day, so he hurried off to learn what all the
row was about. He found Sale and his staff in the west
gate, looking earnestly in the direction of the enemy,
and discussing with the heroic Havelock the probabilities
of an attack. It was a bright moonlight night; everything
visible near or far. All at once some one called out:</p>

<p>“Here they come, sir! Don’t you see those two dark
columns of men 500 yards off?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>Ah! yes. Every one saw them clearly enough.</p>

<p>“I looked a little, and then laughed right out. The
General called to me in his short, sharp way:</p>

<p>“‘Seaton, what is it, sir?’</p>

<p>“‘General, where is the back wall of the old fort?’</p>

<p>“‘Eh! eh! what! what!’ said he testily.</p>

<p>“‘Why, General, you sent me out yesterday to destroy
the back wall of that old fort behind which the
enemy used to muster. The clay was too hard for us,
so, as the wall was just over a sunk road, and the bank
below the wall soft, I threw a dam across the lower part
of the road and turned in yon little stream. I guess it
has softened the bank, and the wall has fallen with a slap
into the water and produced the explosion. The columns
of men are only the shadows of the north and south
walls.’ So we all had a hearty laugh.”</p>

<p>Seaton was on guard every third day. Though the
duty was hard, it was comparatively a day of rest.
During the night officers visited the guards and sentries
every two hours, and made the sentries report everything
they had seen or heard. They patrolled the streets, too,
every two hours, and the picket in the centre of the town
sent patrols to each gate every hour during the night.
Every day, when not on special duty, he went out with
a large working party to destroy the old walls and houses
outside the town, to fell and cut up the trees, and to bring
them in for firewood.</p>

<p>The enemy had some capital marksmen, and several of
our men were shot through the loopholes. Sale now
thought it time to put a stop to this, for they cut off our
supplies and we had only thirty days’ food in store. So
he quietly waited until noon, when the enemy would be
thinking more of food than fighting, and a column of
1,100 infantry was formed in the west street. All the
cavalry that could be mustered, with two of Abbott’s guns,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
assembled in the south street. They had a tough job at
first. The Afghans stood bravely and poured in a heavy
fire; but the moment the cavalry and guns appeared on
the plain clear of Piper’s Hill the whole body of the enemy
fled in every direction. Many were drowned in the river.</p>

<p>During the pursuit Captain Oldfield, who commanded
the cavalry, as he galloped up to a party of the fugitives,
saw one man suddenly stop, throw off his turban, tear
off his clothes, wrap his waist-cloth round his loins and
attempt to personate a Hindoo, calling out, “Shah bash,
Angrèz!” (“Well done, English!”). But our troopers were
not to be deceived: the Hindoo gentleman was instantly
cut down.</p>

<p>Doubtless if the Afghans had possessed the needful
tools they might have succeeded in their plan of cooping
us in and starving us out.</p>

<p>It was to Major Broadfoot’s firmness and foresight that
the brigade was mainly indebted for its honour and
safety. When they were first sent out, Broadfoot was
ordered to proceed without his tools. This he respectfully
but firmly declined to do, and by his manly representations
he carried his point, and was allowed to take them.</p>

<p>They returned at dusk, very hungry and tired. Our
loss had been small, our gain great, and a further result
was that provisions at once began to flow in. People
flocked to the gates to sell flour, grain, and vegetables.
But the officers were all so poor that very few of them
could purchase anything. The soldiers and camp-followers
were still worse off. The commissariat officer
had now six weeks’ food in store, but would the treasure-chest
hold out? Copper coinage had nearly disappeared.</p>

<p>The New Year, 1842, opened ominously, and brought
more evil tidings. A letter from Cabul, from Pottinger,
told them of the murder of the Envoy, that Ghusnee was
besieged, and the whole country in insurrection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>But our garrison was not dismayed. All scouted the
idea of any great disaster happening to our troops at
Cabul, and our works were pushed on with increased
vigour. Provisions kept coming in, and the surplus was
carefully stored.</p>

<p>On the 9th of January a letter from General Elphinstone
was brought in by a horseman, ordering Sale to
retire with his brigade to Peshawar.</p>

<p>It was a crushing, humiliating blow, spreading a gloom
over every heart; but when Sale’s determination was
made known&mdash;to hold Jellalabad until the Cabul force
arrived&mdash;the men’s confidence in their commander was
greater than ever.</p>

<p>The greatest harmony existed between the European
and native soldiers, and there was but one mind in the
garrison&mdash;to defy the Afghans and to redeem as far as
possible the reverses of the Cabul force. They had no
money, they were short of ammunition, and had not too
much food; but there was no thought of giving way.</p>

<p>On the 13th of January Seaton was on guard at the
south gate when, a little after twelve o’clock, some one
came rushing along the passage leading to the guardroom.
The door was burst open, and Lieutenant B&mdash;&mdash;
threw himself into Seaton’s arms, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“My God, Seaton! the whole of the Cabul army has
been destroyed!”</p>

<p>“What! man, are you mad? The whole army?”</p>

<p>“All but one&mdash;Dr. Brydon! We saw from the top
of the gateway a man riding on an old pony. He seemed
to be wounded; he was bending over the pommel. We
sent two horsemen out to bring him in&mdash;it was Dr.
Brydon. He could not speak at first. Then he murmured:
‘The only survivor of Cabul army!&mdash;all killed.’”</p>

<div class="caption">

<p class="header">The Last of an Army</p>

<p>The whole of the Cabul army but one man, Dr. Brydon, was destroyed.</p></div>
</div>

<p>After thinking this over in silence for a minute or two,
they went outside and saw Sale and his staff at the Cabul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
gate hoisting up the colours, a sign to any poor fugitive
who might have escaped. A hearty cheer went up as
they looked on their country’s glorious colours. Their
spirits were still high.</p>

<p>Instantly the cavalry rode out. About four miles
from Jellalabad they found the bodies of three of Brydon’s
companions&mdash;Lieutenant Harper, Collyer, and Hopkins&mdash;all
terribly mangled.</p>

<p>At night lights were hung out over the Cabul gate, and
two buglers were put on duty in the south-west bastion
to sound the advance every quarter of an hour, in hope
that some poor fugitive might hear it and be saved.</p>

<p>“The terrible wailing sound of those bugles I shall
never forget,” says Seaton. “It was a dirge for our
slaughtered soldiers, and had a most mournful and depressing
effect.” Dr. Brydon’s tale struck horror into
the hearts of all who heard it, but mingled with the
sorrow and pity came a fierce desire for vengeance.
Little was said, but the stern looks of the soldiers, the set
teeth, and the clenched hands, showed how deep was the
feeling that had been stirred, and how stern the vow
registered in each man’s heart.</p>

<p>On the 19th a servant of Captain Bazette came in, and
on the 30th a Goorkah. On the 31st they had the
pleasure of welcoming another white face&mdash;a sergeant-major.
From the accounts of the sergeant they gathered
many particulars of this tragedy&mdash;how, after the murder
of our Envoy, General Elphinstone agreed to evacuate
the country and retire with the whole of his force, Akbar,
on his part, undertaking to escort the Cabul force and
guarantee it from attack; how the Afghans rushed into
our cantonments, even before the rear of the British force
had got outside the walls, and began their plundering;
how our men were shot down in the Khoord Cabul Pass;
how Akbar pretended he could not control his men, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
advised the English officers to surrender to him; how the
native soldiers, chilled to death in the snow, went over
to the enemy in hundreds.</p>

<p>The sergeant said in their excuse: “I can’t blame the
natives. I myself was born in a cold climate. I was well
clad, yet my sufferings from the cold were terrible: my
fingers were frost-bitten, and all my joints were sore.
Why, sir, in the next pass the Afghans, after slaughtering
our men till they were tired, stripped hundreds of poor
Hindoos stark naked and left them there to die in the cold.”</p>

<p>Stories such as these only spurred on the garrison of
Jellalabad to greater exertion, for, as they would have
now to face Akbar Khan and all his warriors, on them
devolved the task of redeeming our country’s fame.</p>

<p>On the 30th of January our cavalry brought in 175 head
of cattle that had been grazing at some distance off, and
on the next day they shepherded in 734 sheep.</p>

<p>Now, work on Sunday was remitted. Men came to
morning service with sword and pistol, or musket and
bayonet, and sixty rounds in pouch, ready at a moment’s
notice to march to battle.</p>

<p>“To me,” says Seaton, “it was always an affecting
sight to see these great rough fellows with their heads
bowed, humbly confessing their sins before God, and
acknowledging their dependence on His goodness and
mercy; and I am sure that afterwards, when we were
surrounded by greater perils, there were many who felt
the comfort there was in having One to whom they could
appeal in all their troubles.”</p>

<p>In February they knew that Akbar was collecting his
forces for an attack. On our side the General ordered
that all able-bodied camp-followers who were willing
should be armed and receive the pay of native soldiers.</p>

<p>Those for whom there were no muskets were armed
with pikes, which were made for them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 16th rain came down in torrents; on the 18th
heavy rain again. On the morning of the 19th Seaton
was at work outside when he felt a smart shock of earthquake,
with a rumbling noise. At first he did not take
much notice, but when the rumbling increased and
swelled to the loudest thunder, as if a thousand heavy
waggons were being driven at speed over a rough pavement,
he turned quite sick. An awful fear came over
him. The ground heaved and set like the sea, and the
whole plain seemed to be rolling in waves towards them.
The motion was so violent that some were nearly thrown
down, and expected every moment to see the whole
town swallowed up.</p>

<p>The houses, the walls, and the bastions were rocking
and reeling in a most terrific manner, and falling into
complete ruin, while all along the south and west faces
the parapets, which had cost us so much labour to erect,
were crumbling away like sand. The whole was enveloped
in one immense cloud of dust, out of which came
cries of terror from the hundreds within.</p>

<p>When the dreadful noise and quaking ceased, a dead
silence succeeded, all being so deeply impressed by
the terror of the scene that they dared not utter a sound.
The men were absolutely green with fear. Presently a
gentle breeze sprang up. Officers encouraged the men
to go on with their work, but, looking round the valley,
they saw every fort and village wrapped in dense clouds
of dust. From some the dust was streaming away like
smoke, from others it rose high in the air in dense
columns.</p>

<p>When the breeze had cleared away the dust from Jellalabad
an awful scene of destruction appeared. The
upper stories of the houses were all gone, and beams,
posts, doors, windows, bits of wall, ends of roof, earth
and dust, all were mingled in one confused heap. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
was as if some gigantic hand had taken up the houses
and thrown them down in one rubbish-heap.</p>

<p>The parapets all round had fallen from the walls.
The walls were split in many places. In the eastern wall
a breach had been made large enough for two companies
abreast to walk through.</p>

<p>Sale’s bugle sounded the assembly, and they went in
at once. On muster being taken, it was found that the
loss of life was happily only three men crushed in the
cavalry hospital.</p>

<p>On looking round, it was found that a month’s cannonading
with a hundred pieces of heavy artillery could not
have produced the damage that the earthquake had
effected in a few seconds. “The hand of the Almighty
had indeed humbled our pride, and taught us the wholesome
lesson that He alone is a sure defence.”</p>

<p>The Colonel narrowly escaped with his life. He had
been standing on the wall, which, he said after he was
taken up from the ruins, wriggled like a snake.</p>

<p>In one place, as an officer was passing along the ramparts,
the ground opened beneath him, and he fell in, but
only to be thrown out again&mdash;an operation which was
twice repeated. At a spot near the river the wall had
opened so wide that a man could have slipped through.
All the barracks and sheds were in ruins; all shelter for
the men was destroyed.</p>

<p>This, however, was not the time for idle wonder or for
despair. Without delay every man in garrison was set
to work, and though there were frequent shocks of earthquake
during the day, the ruins had been cleared away
by dusk, and a temporary parapet of clods of earth and
clay made all round the walls.</p>

<p>Towards sunset a small body of horsemen from Akbar’s
camp came to reconnoitre. Abbott, who was looking out,
sent a shot right into the party, making them scamper off,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
probably to report to their chiefs that the fortifications
were uninjured, and that our “magic” had caused the
earthquake.</p>

<p>But we were in a critical state, with all defences
levelled, a huge breach in the works, and the destroyer
of our Cabul force within a few miles of us, with the
whole power of the country at his back.</p>

<p>They had now daily fights for their forage. The grass-cutters
went out at early dawn under a strong escort.
The grass in India is a creeping grass: the shoots run
along under ground, or it would perish in the droughts
of summer.</p>

<p>The grass-cutter, armed with a small hoe, sits down on
his heels, and with a sweeping motion cuts the grass
half an inch below the surface of the ground. He then
collects it, beats off the earth, and brings it home on his
head. This grass is very sweet and nutritious. As the
hot weather advanced they had to go further afield for
grass. On the 2nd of March Akbar sent a large force
round to the east, and they were invested.</p>

<p>“I find this in my journal for the 2nd of March: ‘All our
comforts are vanishing. Tea has long been gone; coffee
goes to-day; sugar on its last legs; butter gone; no grass
for the cows; candles not to be had. Akbar is trying to
starve us out.’”</p>

<p>Lead for the rifles was in great request. Some officers
of the 13th hit upon a very comical method of procuring
it. They dressed up a figure&mdash;cocked hat, red coat,
painted face&mdash;and put it on a short pole. Hoisted up
above the ramparts and managed adroitly, it created no
end of fun.</p>

<p>Eagerly the Afghans fired at it. Thousands of bullets
went over their heads or battered against the wall below.
Whenever they thought the General was hit or saw him
bob down, they yelled and shouted like madmen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>How many Generals must they not have killed!
Generals running short! The figure was hit sometimes.
In the evening or early morning they used to go outside
and pick up the bullets, of which immense numbers were
found. In the course of half an hour one morning Seaton
picked up 121, but several officers picked up more.</p>

<p>From the 2nd of March, the day on which the enemy
established a camp east of the city, they all slept at their
posts on the walls. No one took off his clothes. None
of them wore uniform, but clothes made of camel-hair
cloth. Too much digging for fine uniforms! On the
10th of March, as the Afghans had been thronging the
ravines for many days, Sale thought it wise to see to
it, so a sortie with 800 men was ordered. They thoroughly
examined the ravines at night and destroyed the enemy’s
shelters. As they were retiring into the town the enemy
came on, pursuing with loud yells and screams. Their
horse came boldly down towards the town, offering a
splendid mark for Abbott, whose guns plied them with
shot and shell with deadly effect.</p>

<p>Not a single horseman could stand before Abbott’s
gun within 1,200 yards, his aim was so unerring. Ever
since the siege of Bhurtpoor he had been celebrated for
his skill as an artilleryman, and they had daily proof of
his prowess.</p>

<p>So the month progressed, fighting or working by day,
watching on the walls by night, and all the time on half
rations.</p>

<p>They knew that Government was assembling a force
at Peshawar under Pollock in order to relieve them, for
they got a stray letter now and then.</p>

<p>Hard work, poor food, anxiety, were making all
thin and pale; and some of them were angry with Sale
that he would not go out and fight, for they felt perfectly
capable of squaring accounts with Akbar and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
legions; but “Fighting Bob,” as he was called, would
not come up to his name.</p>

<p>Night after night they were roused from their short
sleep by earthquakes. A sharper shock, a violent heave,
a short cracking sound, and all would start up, listen,
grumble, try to get to sleep again.</p>

<p>Some messengers came in from Peshawar on the 25th.
They heard the men of the 13th in fits of laughter at
some absurd game they were playing, and all the native
soldiers singing in chorus their festival songs. They were
astounded.</p>

<p>“Why,” they said, “you are besieged, and ought to
be sad and dispirited; but you are all as merry as possible.”</p>

<p>When they saw the ease with which a party of Akbar’s
men were beaten in a fight for some grass they were
utterly confounded. When they returned to Peshawar
all this went down the road to the Khyber, with wonderful
additions. It was just the sort of tale that in the
mouths of such men would not lose in the telling.</p>

<p>All this time the greatest cordiality and good feeling
prevailed between the European and native soldiers.</p>

<p>“I remember one case of disagreement,” says Seaton.
“A sepoy of my company met a soldier of the 13th on
a narrow path in the town. The soldier overbalanced
himself, and stepped into the mud.</p>

<p>“Being very hot-tempered, he struck the sepoy a
violent blow. The latter came to me to make his complaint.
The matter was referred to Sale, who was
furious, blew up the English soldier fearfully, and ordered
him to confinement.</p>

<p>“As the Adjutant was marching the soldier off the
sepoy took the soldier by the hand and said: ‘General
Sahib, forgive him. There has not been one quarrel
between any of us ever since the regiments have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
together. You have scolded with him, so I ask you
please forgive him.’</p>

<p>“The General granted the sepoy’s request. The
soldier said he was sorry he had given way to temper
and struck a man who could behave so generously.</p>

<p>“Many of our soldiers had friends among the sepoys,
and I have known more than once a soldier, when dying,
send for his sepoy friend to be with him in his last
moments.”</p>

<p>Akbar had a new idea: he caused large flocks of sheep
to be driven over the distant forage grounds. On the
30th they saw these flocks going within range of the
guns. They looked at them with hungry eyes.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 1st of April a flock of sheep was
driven by the enemy’s shepherds close to the old ruined
fort. Several officers got round Sale and fairly badgered
him into making an attempt to carry them off. Four
hundred men, all the cavalry, and some pikemen, were
ordered out. As they sallied forth Seaton heard a man
on the walls say to a friend, “I say, Bill, what a lark if
we can get in all them sheep!”</p>

<p>The cavalry rode out and got round them. The sheep
were given to the pikemen. The infantry extended in
skirmishing order to check the enemy, who were running
up. The sheep were got in, the last one dropping a
lamb on the very threshold.</p>

<p>They had one man killed and eight wounded, but were
all in the highest spirits, and when the Afghans, dancing
with rage, showed themselves on the hills, they were
saluted with shouts of laughter and a thousand cries of
“B-a-a! b-a-a!”</p>

<p>The garrison got 481 sheep and a few goats. The
General gave forty sheep to the men of Seaton’s regiment
(natives); but they, with great good-feeling, desired that
the sheep should be given to the English soldiers, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
whom, they said, such food was necessary, while they
could do very well on their rations. Bravo, 35th Native
Infantry! A grateful letter came in return from the
non-commissioned officers and privates of the 13th L.I.
to Colonel Dennie, ending with, “Believe me, sir, that
feeling is more gratifying to us than the value of the gift,
and we shall ever feel the obligation our old comrades
and brother campaigners have placed us under.”</p>

<p>On the 3rd a spy came in and told them that when
Akbar learnt that they had captured his sheep, he burst
into such a transport of fury that his people were afraid
to go near him.</p>

<p>On the 6th of April they heard that Pollock had been
repulsed in the Khyber Pass, and at noon Akbar fired a
royal salute in honour of his victory.</p>

<p>All the officers now went to Sale and urged on him the
absolute necessity of going out and fighting Akbar.</p>

<p>Sale saw that the time for action had arrived.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 7th strong guards were posted
at the gates, a picket in the centre of the town, and all
pikemen, sick and wounded soldiers, etc., were sent to
man the walls, and a very respectable show they made.</p>

<p>With the first peep of dawn the gates were quietly
opened, and the three columns, under Dennie, Monteath,
and Havelock, sallied out.</p>

<p>The plan was to march direct on Akbar’s camp, burn
it, drive him into the river, and bring off his guns.</p>

<p>They wasted some time in attacking a ruinous fort,
and Colonel Dennie was mortally wounded. Then Sale
called off the troops, and they went straight for Akbar.</p>

<p>The sound of the guns had roused all the enemy’s force,
and they were turning out in thousands. It was a grand
sight to see their large masses of horse coming down
from the hills. They charged boldly on Havelock’s
column, which, rapidly thrown into square, received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
them with the greatest coolness, and repulsed them with
heavy loss.</p>

<p>They then made an attack on Seaton’s regiment, but
at this moment two guns of Abbott’s battery came up
and sent shot and shell crashing into the enemy’s ranks,
making them recoil faster than they had advanced.</p>

<p>The English soon came within sight of the Afghan
camp, from whence the enemy opened fire on them,
which caused some loss. But they made a rush and
carried the camp without a check, while the enemy fled
through the groves of trees beyond. They tried to carry
off one of the guns, but a shot by Abbott killed the two
horses attached to the limber, and the artillerymen fled.
Numbers of the fugitives threw themselves into the river,
which, swollen and rapid, destroyed the greatest part of
them.</p>

<p>The whole of Akbar’s camp fell into our hands. His
guns, ammunition, standards, plunder&mdash;everything he
had with him. The bugle soon recalled the skirmishers,
and Seaton was detached with a party to fire the tents
and the huts, made of boughs and reeds. The smoke of
the burning proclaimed our victory to the whole valley.
Numbers of camels and mounds of grain fell into our hands.</p>

<p>“I secured three noble camels for myself, and right
good service they did me afterwards.”</p>

<p>Sale was anxious to get back to Jellalabad, so the men
returned in triumph, each man carrying off what he
pleased, and were received with loud cheers from the
walls. A little after dark the news was brought in by
some Hindoos living in the valley that every fort and
village within eight miles had been deserted.</p>

<p>This night they slept in bed, perfectly undisturbed.
After passing the last thirty-six nights on the ramparts,
armed and accoutred, constantly roused by the enemy,
by their own rounds, by the relief of sentries, by those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
terrible earthquakes, many nights drenched by rain
without shelter, quiet rest in a real bed for the whole
night was an unspeakable luxury; “but coupled with
the thought that, unaided, we had broken the toils cast
round us by Akbar Khan; that we had beaten in fair
fight the chief who had destroyed our Cabul army; that
months of toil, watching, anxiety, and peril had been
crowned with glorious success; that our country’s honour
was safe in our hands, it was positive bliss, such as few
have had the happiness to taste.”</p>

<p>On this night even the earthquakes spared them&mdash;no
sudden roar, no sharp electric shock, no far-off rumbling
sound, no sharp crack of doom to startle them from their
well-earned repose. It was bliss!</p>

<p>It was observed that earthquakes usually followed
much rain, thus raising the question whether steam may
not often be the origin of the phenomenon.</p>

<p>Next day they found 580 rounds of ammunition for the
captured guns. Now food began to pour in from the
country, and they lived on the fat of the land.</p>

<p>News came in that Pollock had forced the Khyber, and
would arrive about the 15th.</p>

<p>At length, on the morning of the 14th, they could see
with their glasses Pollock’s force coming near. They
had not arrived in time to help the garrison in their
imminent peril. They had lost the grand opportunity of
joining with them to crush the man whose treachery had
destroyed their brothers-in-arms, whose bones lay
scattered in the icy passes of Cabul. A fifth part of
Pollock’s cavalry would have enabled them to annihilate
Akbar and all his troops.</p>

<p>So when next morning Pollock’s force did arrive, there
was a hearty welcome, but a sly bit of sarcasm in the
tune to which the band of the 13th played them in,
“Ye’re ower lang o’ comin’.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not Pollock’s fault, however. He had to wait
for the troops to join him at Peshawar.</p>

<p>“Let me relate one incident,” writes Colonel Seaton,
“that will tend to illustrate the character of my old
commander, General Sir R. Sale.</p>

<p>“Shortly after Akbar’s camp appeared in sight it was
whispered about in garrison that Akbar intended to bring
Lady Sale, then a prisoner in his hands, before the walls,
and put her to torture within sight, and so compel Sale
to surrender.</p>

<p>“Every day when the men were at dinner Sale used to
take a turn on the ramparts, ostensibly to have a quiet
look round at the progress of our works, but in reality,
I believe, to ponder on the desperate situation of his
wife and daughter, and debate with himself the means
of effecting their rescue.</p>

<p>“We knew that they were well, had hitherto been kindly
treated, and were in Akbar’s fort, not many miles off.</p>

<p>“One day Sale, in going his rounds, came and stood
over the south gate, where I was on duty; so, as I had
enjoyed the privilege of great intimacy with him and
Lady Sale at Cabul, I went out and joined him. I
ventured to mention this report, and asked him what
he would do if it should prove true, and if Akbar should
put his threat into execution.</p>

<p>“Turning towards me, his face pale and stern, but
quivering with deep emotion, he replied:</p>

<p>“‘I&mdash;I will have every gun turned on her. My old
bones shall be buried beneath the ruins of the fort here,
but I will never surrender!’”</p>

<p>Could Lady Sale have heard it, her heart would have
bounded with pride, for the heroine was worthy of her hero.</p>

<p>The reception of the garrison by Lord Ellenborough
at Ferozepoor was a noble and ample return for all
their toil and suffering. His lordship had taken care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
that each officer and man of the “illustrious garrison,”
as he termed them, should have a medal, and they were
sent out to them before they reached Ferozepoor.</p>

<p>Not an English officer in India at this time had such a
mark of distinction. They were the first to be so honoured,
and were highly gratified by it.</p>

<p>On the morning on which they marched in, the bridge
of boats over the Sutlej was gaily ornamented with
flags and streamers. His lordship met them at the
bridge head, and was the first to welcome them as they
stepped on the soil of our own provinces. All the troops
in camp were drawn up in line at open order, and received
them as they passed with presented arms. Lord
Ellenborough also ordered that at each station they
marched through on their way to their destination the
same military honours should be rendered to them. The
garrison were received with similar marks of distinction
at Kurnaul, at Delhi, and at Agra.</p>

<p>“We may forget everything else, but we shall never
forget Lord Ellenborough’s noble and ever-ready kindness
and the many honours he caused to be shown us.
One word more: After the Mutiny, it is not to be wondered
at that the sepoy was written down as a demon
and a coward; but we had known him as an excellent
soldier, generally mild and humane and temperate as
a man, sometimes even generous and forgiving, as the
best of Christians.”</p>

<p>When will it become the English custom to recite before
our young of both sexes some of the deeds which have
saved the Empire, “lest we forget”? If not in church,
at least in school, we should make this effort to save our
children from ignorance, which is ingratitude.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />
<span class="smaller">SIEGE OF SEBASTOPOL (1854-1856)</span></h2>

<p class="summary">The English land without tents&mdash;Mr. Kinglake shows off before Lord
Raglan&mdash;The Alma&mdash;Strange escapes&mdash;Looted houses&mdash;Fair
plunder&mdash;Balaklava Bay&mdash;Horses lost at sea&mdash;A derelict worth
having&mdash;Jack very helpful&mdash;The Heavy and Light Brigades&mdash;Spies&mdash;Fraternizing.</p>

<p>The Crimean War, fought between Russia on the one
hand and England, France, Turkey, and Sardinia on the
other, consisted mainly in the Siege of Sebastopol, a
strong fortified port in the South of Russia. They
fought ostensibly about the guardianship of the Holy
Sepulchre in Jerusalem, but really because Turkey was
thought to be decaying, and Russia wished to protect the
Slavonic races in her own interest, and to extend her
power to the Dardanelles. The war was characterized
by the great sufferings of the troops during the winter,
intensified by storms in the Black Sea, where so many
transports laden with warm clothing went to the bottom
that our men were left unprotected.</p>

<p>Even at the first landing, on the 14th of September,
1854, these sufferings commenced. Imagine a bare and
desolate beach, the home of seagull and wild-fowl, suddenly
turned into a barrack-yard. From one end to the
other bayonets glistened, red coats and brass-mounted
shakos gleamed in solid masses. The transports were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
tossing yonder out in the offing, and as gig or cutter
grounded on the sand the officers of each company first
landed, each in full dress, and carried his greatcoat,
fastened by a strap round his body. After the officers
came the men, bearing rations for three days in their
wallets. Before they were all well on shore the rain
began, and the wind was sending a little surf on the
beach. The horses were not yet landed, so Generals and
staff-officers might be seen sitting on powder-barrels
on the shore, retiring gloomily within the folds of cape
and mackintosh. Disconsolate doctors were groaning
after hospital panniers which had not yet arrived; for,
strange to say, more than one man died on that beach.</p>

<p>The country people, though at first full of fear of the
invaders, soon brought food to sell, and retired with
twinkling eyes. They were of Tartar race, with small
eyes set wide apart and high cheek-bones.</p>

<p>That first night in the Crimea! Twenty thousand
Englishmen, and not one tent amongst them! The
wind rose and the rain fell in sheets, piercing through the
greatcoats and blankets of the soldiers. Their only
bed was the reeking puddles. They had no fire to cheer
them, no hot grog. They were just miserable, while the
French and the Turks were lying snug under canvas.</p>

<p>No wonder that there was a great increase in illness
among the troops. Next day the surf was so heavy that
many boats were stove in, and the work of landing horses
and guns was difficult.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 20th, as Lord Raglan, the Commander-in-Chief,
was waiting, surrounded by his staff,
for the troops to get into position, a gentleman joined
them on a handsome grey pony.</p>

<p>The pony began neighing and screaming so loudly that
no one could hear a word that was said. Lord Raglan
turned and asked:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>“Does anyone know who that gentleman is?”</p>

<p>One of the staff replied: “I think it is one of the
newspaper reporters, my lord. Shall I ask him to go
away?”</p>

<p>Lord Raglan laughed, and said: “If you do, he will
show you up, you may depend upon it.”</p>

<p>“It is Mr. Kinglake, the author of ‘Eōthen,’” said
another.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said my lord, “a most charming man,” and
was going to speak to him, when the French Marshal
St. Arnaud rode up and prevented it.</p>

<p>About an hour after, as Lord Raglan was nearing the
Russian position, a pony dashed past at a furious pace,
and who should it be but Mr. Kinglake, the future historian
of the Crimean War? On he went right through
the skirmishers, with his horse’s head between his legs.
Fortunately for the rider, the saddle got forward, and
soon went over the horse’s ears. Of course the author of
“Eōthen” went with the saddle, which was better than
riding into the enemy’s lines.</p>

<p>It struck the staff as rather an absurd thing just
before a battle, and they all laughed; but Lord Raglan
rode up and offered him another pony. Mr. Kinglake
has not mentioned this personal adventure in his
history.</p>

<p>Then came the Battle of the Alma, a river at that time
of year only knee-deep. It cost us nearly 3,000 men
killed or wounded. They say the individual escape of
officers and men was miraculous. Chin-straps were shot
off, buttons carried away, belts torn, coats ripped&mdash;all
without further injury to the wearer. Many hundred
Russians threw away their arms and accoutrements in
their flight. On the further heights, about a mile and
a half from the Alma, the British troops ceased their
pursuit; and then arose such a cheer&mdash;a cheer from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
20,000 victorious men. Even some of the wounded
fellows joined in it.</p>

<p>“I shall never forget that cheer as long as I live,”
writes an officer. “It was indeed thrilling. I almost
pitied the fallen enemy; it must have been so galling to
them. I heard a man of the Guards say to a comrade:
‘I say, Bill, pleasant for them poor devils’ (pointing
to some wounded Russians), ‘hearing our chaps cheer
like that.’</p>

<p>“Lord Raglan rode up and down the line, the men
cheering him heartily. There was such a shaking of
hands. One felt very choky about the throat and very
much inclined to cry as one wrung the hand of a friend.
‘God bless you, old fellow! So glad to see you all
right!’ and so on. It was a touching sight to see the
meeting between Lord Raglan and Sir Colin Campbell.
The latter was on foot, as his horse had been killed under
him. He went up to his lordship and, with tears in his
eyes, shook hands, saying it was not the first battle-field
they had won together. The battle was over at twenty
minutes to four p.m.”</p>

<p>Next morning the poor wounded were far more quiet.
Many had died during the night. Numbers of our men
were going about among the wounded before it was light,
giving them drinks of water. All those shot through the
head died with a smile on their faces. “Some looked so
happy, poor fellows! that one felt comforted.” On the
23rd of September order was given to prepare for marching,
and the army left the heights of the Alma.</p>

<p>But what is that grey mass on the plain, almost lying
without life or motion? Now and then, indeed, an arm
may be seen waved aloft, or a man raises himself for a
moment, looks around, and then lies down again.</p>

<p>Alas! that plain is covered with the wounded Russians
still.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>Nearly sixty long hours have they passed in agony on
the wet ground, and now the English must leave them as
they lie. Seven hundred and fifty wounded men are still
on the ground, and we can do nothing for them. Their
wounds have been bound and dressed by us, and Lord
Raglan has told the head-man of a Tartar village to do
what he can for them.</p>

<p>At first the country was hilly and barren, but on coming
to the valley of the Katcha there were beautiful verdure,
shrubs, white villas and snug cottages, vineyards and
gardens.</p>

<p>A guide-post showed they were ten miles from Sebastopol.
The road now looked like a byway in Devon or
Hampshire. Low walls were surmounted by fruit-trees,
laden with apples, pears, peaches, and apricots, all ripe
and fit for use.</p>

<p>The first villa they came to was the residence of a
country surgeon. It had been ruthlessly destroyed by
the Cossacks. A veranda, laden with clematis, roses,
and honeysuckle, was filled with broken chairs and tables.
All the glass of the windows was smashed. There lay
on the grass outside the hall-door two side-saddles, a
parasol, and a big whip. The wine-casks were broken
and spilt; the barley and corn of the granary were tossed
about; broken china and glass were scattered over the
floors; and amid all the desolation and ruin of the place
a cat sat blandly on the threshold, winking her eyes in
the sunshine at the new-comers. The scene within was
awful. The beds had been ripped open, and the feathers
littered the rooms a foot deep; chairs, sofas, bookcases,
pictures, images of saints, needlework, bottles, physic-jars,
all smashed or torn, lay in heaps in every room.
Even the walls and doors were hacked with swords. It
was as if the very genius of destruction had been at work
and had revelled in mischief. Every other house and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
villa that they passed was a similar scene to this. Grand
pianos and handsome pieces of furniture covered with
silk and velvet, rent to pieces with brutal violence, were
found in the larger houses.</p>

<p>The houses consist of one story only, size being gained
by lateral extension. Each house has a large patch of
vineyard round it. A porch covered with vines protects
the entrance. They learnt from a deserter that the
natives were hiding because they expected to be shot;
also, that the Russians in their retreat had been seized
with panic in the night, and had rushed off pell-mell;
indeed, the state of the roads favoured this, for they were
littered with linstocks, cartridges, and caps all the way.
Our soldiers now fared on the richest of grapes and the
choicest pears, but they were not allowed to waste or
plunder.</p>

<p><i>September 25.</i>&mdash;On the march to Balaklava they got
near the enemy. They proved to be the baggage-guard
of a large detachment. A few rounds, a cavalry charge,
the Rifles in skirmishing order, and they broke, leaving
baggage of every description strewed over the ground for
two miles.</p>

<p>This was fair and lawful plunder, and the troops were
halted and allowed to take what they liked and what they
could carry. The officers presided over it to see that there
was no quarrelling. Immense quantities of wearing
apparel, dressing-cases, valuable ornaments, and jewellery
were found in the carts.</p>

<p>A Russian artillery officer, found in one of the carriages,
was in a very jovial mood, beside an empty champagne
bottle. Fine winter cloaks, lined with fur, were found
in abundance. This plunder put our soldiers in great
good-humour, and they marched on the whole day in
excellent spirits.</p>

<p>As the baggage was some miles behind, Lord Raglan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
had to put up in a miserable little lodge, while his staff
slept on the ground in a ditch outside.</p>

<p>Not the smallest attempt was made by the enemy to
annoy the English during this march to Balaklava; but
we could have been greatly harassed by the smallest
activity on their part. The march lay through woods,
along bad and often precipitous roads, and a few trees
felled at intervals could have stopped our army for hours.
We had, it seems, taken the Russians by surprise, and
they showed themselves quite destitute of resources.</p>

<p>“<i>Balaklava, September 24.</i>&mdash;I never was more astonished
in my life,” writes Sir W. Russell, “than when I
halted on the top of one of the numerous hills of which
this part of the Crimea is composed, and looking far down,
saw under my feet a little pond, closely shut in by the
sides of high, rocky mountains. On this pond floated
six or seven English ships, for which exit seemed quite
hopeless. The bay is like a highland tarn. It is long
ere the eye admits that it is some half-mile in length from
the sea, and varies from 250 to 120 yards in breadth.
The shores are so steep and precipitous that they shut
out the expanse of the harbour, and make it appear much
smaller than it really is.</p>

<p>“Towards the sea the cliffs close up and completely
overlap the narrow channel which leads to the haven,
so that it is quite invisible.</p>

<p>“On the south-east of the poor village which straggles
between the base of the rocky hills and the margin of the
sea there are extensive ruins of a Genoese fort, built
some 200 feet above the level of the sea, all crumbling
in decay&mdash;bastion and tower and wall. A narrow defile
leads to the town. A few resolute men posted here might
have given great trouble to a large army.”</p>

<p>The staff advanced first on the town, and were proceeding
to enter it, when, to their surprise, from some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
old forts above came four spirts of smoke, and down
came four shells close to them. The dose of shell was
repeated; but by this time the <i>Agamemnon</i> outside the
rocks was heard busily sending her shot against the fort.
After a few rounds the fort was summoned, hung out a
flag of truce, and surrendered. There were only sixty
men&mdash;all made prisoners.</p>

<p>As Lord Raglan entered at noon the principal street,
the inhabitants came out to meet him, bearing trays
laden with fruit and flowers. Others bore loaves of
bread cut up in pieces and placed on dishes covered with
salt, in token of goodwill and submission. The fleet
and army were once more united. Lord Raglan had
secured his base of operations. Towards evening the
huge bulk of the <i>Agamemnon</i> glided in between the rocks
of the entrance, to the joy and delight of all on shore.</p>

<p>“<i>October 3.</i>&mdash;Sebastopol is not yet invested. It is
only threatened on the south and south-east side by the
army, while the fleet attacks it from the east. There is
an enormous boom across the entrance, and many ships
have been sunk close to shore. The Russians can throw
shot further from their batteries than we can from our
decks. Their shot went over us the other day when ours
were falling 500 yards short.</p>

<p>“Since we landed in the Crimea as many have died of
cholera as perished at the Alma. The deserters say that
thirty Russian ladies went out of Sebastopol to see the
Alma battle, as though they were going to a picnic. They
were quite assured of the success of the Russian troops, and
great was their dismay when they had to fly for their lives.</p>

<p>“Bad news to-day about the Dragoons’ horses. Some
200 horses coming from Varna have perished <i>en route</i>.
The sea ran high: fittings and horse-boxes gave way, and
the horses got loose upon the deck, and were killed or
washed overboard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>“<i>October 9.</i>&mdash;An amusing incident has happened.
Towards noon a large ship, under Austrian colours, was
seen standing in towards Sebastopol. The Russian
Fort Constantine opened fire on her at 2,500 yards, but
the ship paid no attention to the shot and shell which
flew over her. The other Russian batteries followed suit;
still the Austrian cared not. Not a sheet did she slack,
while the shot struck her hull and rigging. She came
right past the batteries, and passed them unscathed,
nearing the shore as she came. The <i>Firebrand</i> went to
her assistance, and received several shot in her hull while
doing so, but Captain Stuart persevered and brought her
off. What do you think? Why, she had been deserted
by her crew when the wind failed and she was getting too
near Sebastopol. But she was laden with 600 tons of
hay for the English army. Her escape is almost miraculous,
but it is a proof of the bad gunnery of the Russians.</p>

<p>“<i>October 13.</i>&mdash;It is now eighteen days since our army,
by a brilliant march on Balaklava, obtained its magnificent
position on the south side of Sebastopol. Up to
this moment not a British or French gun has replied to
the fire of the enemy. The Russians have employed the
interval in throwing up earthworks, trenches, and batteries,
to cover the south side of the town.</p>

<p>“The delay had been quite unavoidable. We had to
send all our guns and material round by sea, and land it
as best we could. All these enormous masses of metal
were to be dragged by men or a few horses over a steep
and hilly country a distance of eight miles. You have
some idea of the severity of the work in the fact that
on the 10th no less than thirty-three ammunition horses
were found dead. We had now opened out about
1,500 yards of trench fit for the reception of heavy
guns.</p>

<p>“‘Jack’ made himself very useful to us. The only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
thing against him was that he is too strong. He pulls
strong carts to pieces as if they were toys; he piles up
shot-cases in the waggons till the horses fall under the
weight, for he cannot understand ‘the ship starting
till the hold is full.’ But it is most cheering to meet a
lot of these jolly fellows working up a gun to the camp:
from a distance you can hear a hearty English chorus
borne on the breeze. The astonishment of the stupid,
fur-capped Crim Tartars, as they stare at the wondrous
apparition of our hairy Hercules, is ludicrous to a degree;
but ‘Jack’ salutes every foreigner who goes by with the
same cry, ‘Bono, Johnny!’ and still the song proceeds.</p>

<p>“<i>October 22.</i>&mdash;Lord Dunkellin, Captain Coldstream
Guards, was taken prisoner this morning. He was out
with a working party of his regiment, which had got a
little out of their way, when a number of men were
observed through the dawning light in front of them.
‘They are the Russians!’ exclaimed one of his men.
‘Nonsense! they’re our fellows,’ said his lordship, and
went off towards them, asking in a high tone as he got
near: ‘Who is in command of this party?’ His men
saw him no more. The Russians fired no shot, but merely
closed round and seized him before he could get away.</p>

<p>“<i>October 25.</i>&mdash;At half-past seven this morning an
orderly came galloping in to the head-quarters camp
from Balaklava with the news that at dawn a strong
corps of Russian horse, supported by guns and battalions
of infantry, had marched into the valley, and had already
nearly dispersed the Turks of the redoubt No. 1, and
that they were opening fire on the other redoubts, which
would soon be in their hands unless the Turks offered a
stouter resistance. Sir George Cathcart and H.R.H.
the Duke of Cambridge were ordered to put their divisions,
the fourth and the first, in motion for the scene of action.
Sir Colin Campbell, who was in command of Balaklava,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
had drawn up the 93rd Highlanders in front of the road
to the town. The French artillerymen and Zouaves
prepared for action along their lines.</p>

<p>“Lord Lucan’s little camp was full of excitement. The
men had not had time to water their horses; they had
not broken their fast yet, and had barely saddled at the
first blast of the trumpet, when they were drawn up on
the slope behind the redoubts. Soon after eight o’clock
Lord Raglan and his staff cantered up towards our rear;
a French General, Bosquet, with his staff and an escort of
Hussars, followed at a gallop.</p>

<p>“Never did the painter’s eye rest on a more beautiful
scene than I beheld from the ridge. The fleecy vapours
still hung around the mountain-tops, and mingled with
the ascending volumes of smoke from the cannonade;
the patch of sea sparkled freshly in the rays of the morning
sun, but its light was eclipsed by the flashes which
gleamed from the masses of armed men below.</p>

<p>“To our disgust, we saw the Turks fly at the approach
of the Russians; but the horse-hoof of the Cossack was
too quick for them, and sword and lance were busily
plied among the retreating herd. The yells of the
pursuers and pursued were plainly audible. The Turks
betake themselves to the Highlanders, where they check
their flight, and form into companies on the Scotsmens’
flanks.</p>

<p>“The Russian cavalry, seeing the Highlanders, halt
till they have about 1,500 men along the ridge&mdash;Lancers,
Dragoons, and Hussars. They drew breath for a moment,
and then in one grand line dashed at the Highlanders,
who were drawn up two deep. The ground flies beneath
their horses’ feet; gathering speed at every stride, they
dash on towards that thin red streak topped with a line
of steel.</p>

<p>“The Turks fire a volley at 800 yards and run. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
the Russians come within 600 yards, down goes that
line of steel in front, and out rings a rolling volley of
minié musketry. The distance is too great; the Russians
come on. With breathless suspense every one awaits
the bursting of the wave upon the line of Gaelic rock;
but ere they come within 150 yards, another deadly
volley flashes from the levelled rifle, carrying death and
terror into the Russians. They wheel about, open files
right and left, and fly back faster than they came.
‘Bravo, Highlanders! well done!’ shout the excited
spectators.</p>

<p>“But events thicken. The Russians&mdash;evidently <i>corps
d’élite</i>&mdash;their light blue jackets embroidered with silver
lace, were advancing at an easy gallop towards the brow
of the hill. A forest of lances glistened in their rear,
and squadrons of grey-coated Dragoons moved up to
support them.</p>

<p>“The instant they came in sight the trumpets of our
cavalry gave out the warning blast which told us all
that in another moment we should see the shock of
battle beneath our very eyes. Lord Raglan, all his
staff and escort, groups of officers, Zouaves, French
Generals and officers, bodies of French infantry on the
heights, were spectators of the scene, as though they were
looking on the stage from the boxes of a theatre. Nearly
every one dismounted and sat down in deep silence.</p>

<p>“The Russians rode down the hill at a slow canter,
which they changed to a trot, and at last nearly halted.
Their line was at least double the length of ours,
and it was three times as deep. Behind them was a
similar line, equally strong and compact. They evidently
despised their insignificant-looking enemy, but their
time was come. The trumpets rang out again through
the valley: the Scots Greys and the Enniskillens went
right at the centre of the Russian cavalry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>“The space between them was only a few hundred
yards; it was barely enough to let the horses gather
way. The Russian line brings forward each wing as
our horse advance, and threatens to annihilate them as
they pass.</p>

<p>“Turning a little to the left to meet the Russian right,
the Greys rush on with a cheer that thrills to every heart;
the wild shout of the Enniskillens rises at the same
instant. As lightning flashes through a cloud, the
Greys and Enniskillens pierce through the dark masses
of the Russians. The shock was but for a moment.
There was a clash of steel, a light play of sword-blades
in the air, and then the Greys and the red-coats vanish
in the midst of the shaken and quivering columns. In
another moment we see them emerging and dashing on
with diminished numbers, in broken order, against the
second line, which is advancing against them as fast as
it can to retrieve the fortune of the charge.</p>

<p>“It was a terrible moment. God help them! they are
lost!</p>

<p>“With unabated fire the noble hearts rode at their
enemy. It was a fight of heroes. The first line of
Russians, though broken, had turned, and were coming
back to swallow up our poor handful of men. By sheer
steel and sheer courage Enniskillen and Scot were
winning their desperate way right through the enemy’s
squadrons, and already grey horses and red coats had
appeared at the rear of the second mass, when, with
irresistible force, the 1st Royals, the 4th Dragoon Guards,
and the 5th, rushed at the remnants of the first line of
the enemy, went through it as though it were made of
pasteboard, and dashing on the second body of Russians,
still disordered by the terrible assault of the Greys and
Irish, put them to utter rout. A cheer burst from every
lip. In the enthusiasm officers and men took off their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
caps and shouted with delight, clapping their hands
again and again.”</p>

<p>Lord Raglan at once despatched Lord Curzon to
convey his congratulations to General Scarlett, and to
say “Well done!”</p>

<p>The gallant old officer’s face beamed with pleasure
when he received the message. Our loss was very slight&mdash;about
thirty-five killed and wounded.</p>

<p>Presently General Canrobert, attended by his staff,
rode up to Lord Raglan, and complimented him upon the
magnificent charge of our cavalry.</p>

<p>It was shortly after this that the historic charge
of the Light Brigade took place, owing to an order misinterpreted.
Lord Lucan received a written order from
Brigadier Airey through Captain Nolan to advance his
cavalry nearer to the enemy.</p>

<p>“Where are we to advance to?” asked Lord Lucan.</p>

<p>Captain Nolan pointed with his finger to the mass
of Russian cavalry, the six battalions of infantry, and
the thirty guns that faced them, and said: “There are
the enemy, sir, and there are the guns; it is your duty
to take them.”</p>

<p>Don Quixote in his tilt against the windmill was not
so rash and reckless as the gallant fellows who prepared
thus to rush on almost certain death.</p>

<p>It is a maxim of war that “cavalry never act without
a support,” that infantry should be close at hand. The
only support our light cavalry had was the reserve of
heavy cavalry a long way behind them.</p>

<p>As they swept proudly past, officers could scarcely
believe the evidence of their senses. Surely that handful
of men are not going to charge an army in position!
At the distance of 1,200 yards from thirty iron mouths
there belched forth a flood of smoke and flame. There
were instant gaps in our ranks&mdash;dead men and horses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
riderless horses starting aside&mdash;but the remnant rode on
into the smoke of the batteries. You could see their
sabres flashing as they cut down the gunners; you saw
them return, break through a column of infantry, then,
exposed to a flank fire from the battery on the hill,
scattered, broken, wounded, dismounted, flying towards
their base. But at this moment a large body of Lancers
was hurled on their flank. They were cutting their
way through this mass when there took place an act of
atrocity without parallel in modern warfare. The Russian
gunners had returned to their guns: they saw their own
cavalry mingled with the troopers who had just ridden
over them, and, to their eternal disgrace, poured in a
murderous volley of grape and canister, thus mingling
friend and foe in one common ruin.</p>

<p>All our operations in the trenches were lost sight of
in the interest of this melancholy day, in which our
Light Brigade was annihilated by their own rashness
and by the brutality of a ferocious enemy.</p>

<p>“<i>November 3.</i>&mdash;There were many spies in our camp&mdash;sometimes
dressed like French officers&mdash;and we not
clever enough to detect the bad French. The other
night the sentinel before the house of the Provost-Marshal
in Balaklava was astonished to see a horse, with a sack
of corn on his back, deliberately walking past him in
the moonlight. He went over to seize the animal, when
the sack of corn suddenly became changed into a full-grown
Cossack, who drove the spurs into his horse and
vanished!</p>

<p>“Our sentries often fraternized with the Russian
sentries. A few nights ago our men saw some Russian
soldiers coming towards them without arms, and they
supposed them to be deserters; but, on coming nearer,
they made signs that they wanted a light for their pipes,
and then they stayed a few minutes, talking. First<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
Russian: ‘Englise bono!’ First Englishman: ‘Ruskie
bono!’ Second Russian: ‘Oslem no bono!’ Second
Englishman: ‘Ah, Turk no bono!’ pretending to run
away as if frightened, upon which all the party go into
roars of laughter, and then, after shaking hands, they
retire to their respective beats, ready for the bloody
work of war.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />
<span class="smaller">AFTER INKERMANN (1854-55)</span></h2>

<p class="summary">Valiant deeds&mdash;Lord Raglan under fire&mdash;Tryon the best shot&mdash;A
Prince’s button&mdash;A cold Christmas&mdash;Savage horses&mdash;The Mamelon
redoubt&mdash;Corporal Quin&mdash;Colonel Zea.</p>

<p>The Battle of Inkermann was fought on the 5th of
November, 1854, in a thick fog. It began very early in
the morning with a surprise, and developed into a series
of desperate deeds of daring, of hand-to-hand fights, of
despairing rallies, of desperate assaults in glen and valley,
in brushwood glades and remote dells. At six o’clock
in the morning our men of the Second Division were roused
by their tents being ripped to pieces by Russian shells.
In darkness, gloom, and rain the British troops sallied
forth to meet the foe&mdash;with the bayonet if they could.</p>

<p>Many valiant deeds were done. Some were noted,
many were unmarked. Lieutenant Crosse was surrounded
by Russians, who attacked him with the bayonet,
though he was badly wounded. He shot two with his
revolver. Then a private, running up to help him, shot
another, bayonetted the fourth, and carried the Lieutenant
away in his arms.</p>

<p>MacGrath was captured by two Russians, but while
they were leading him away he seized the firelock of one
of them, shot the Russian, and dashed out the brains of
the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>Burke was surrounded just as a ball broke his jawbone.
He rushed amongst his enemies, shot three dead
with his revolver, and cut two men down with his sword.
He fell at last with more than thirty wounds in his body.</p>

<p>When Sir George Cathcart was shot and our men were
retiring, Colonel Seymour, of the Guards, a dear friend
who had served with him through the campaign in Kaffirland,
rushed forward to help him, and in so doing was
shot through the leg.</p>

<p>“Come back, Colonel!” the men shouted as they
swept past the two officers.</p>

<p>“No, no; my place is here with Sir George,” replied
Seymour.</p>

<p>“You must leave him,” cried General Torrens; “the
enemy are close at hand. You will be killed, man!”</p>

<p>But nothing could persuade the Colonel to leave the
side of his dying chief. There he remained, alone against
the rushing tide of battle, and met a hero’s death in
endeavouring to protect his friend from insult and
mutilation.</p>

<p>When, later in the day, some of the French troops
were seen to retire before the impetuous onslaught of the
Russian masses, Lord Raglan despatched an aide-de-camp
to General Pennefather, who was near the French
division, to ask how he was getting on.</p>

<p>The General sent word in reply that he could hold his
own perfectly well, and that he thought the enemy looked
like retiring.</p>

<p>“If I can be reinforced with fresh troops, I will follow
the Russians up and lick them to the devil.”</p>

<p>Lord Raglan was so delighted with this spirited answer
that he galloped over to the French General Canrobert
and translated General Pennefather’s words literally to him.</p>

<p>“Jusqu’au diable, Général!” That was what he said.</p>

<p>Canrobert, who had just remounted his horse, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
having his arm bound up, exclaimed: “Ah! quel brave
garçon! quel brave homme! quel bon Général!”</p>

<p>The day ended with a great artillery duel, in which
Colonel Dickson won great renown, and mowed down
great lanes through the massed forces opposed to him,
until they broke and fled.</p>

<p>Captain Peel, of H.M.S. <i>Diamond</i>, greatly distinguished
himself for his marvellous sang-froid in action. A shell
fell close to a gun which he was laying in the trenches.
Instead of running to take cover, he picked up the shell
and lifted it over the parapet. The shell exploded just
after it left his hands, and did no damage, whereas had
it burst on the spot where it fell, probably many men
would have been killed and wounded.</p>

<p>A private of the 33rd (Duke of Wellington’s) Regiment
was surprised and made prisoner by two Russian soldiers
when an advanced sentry. One of the Russians took
possession of his musket and the other of his pouch, and
they marched him between them towards Sebastopol.
It was not the direction which Tommy wanted to take,
so he kept wary watch, and when he fancied his captors
were off their guard, he sprang on the one who carried his
musket, seized it, knocked the fellow down, and then shot
dead the Russian who carried his pouch. Meanwhile
the Ruskie from whom Tommy had taken his own musket
rose up from his recumbent position, fired and missed his
aim. Tommy promptly hit him on the head with the butt
end of his musket. After this the Englishman proceeded
at leisure to take off his foes’ accoutrements, and he
returned to his post laden with spoils, being fired at by the
Russian sentries and cheered loudly by the English pickets.</p>

<p class="header">Getting rid of his Captors</p>

<p>An English private was taken prisoner by two Russians. When he thought they
were off their guard he snatched his own musket and felled one of them, and then shot
the other dead. The first tried to shoot the Englishman, but missed, and was then
promptly hit on the head with the butt end.</p></div>
</div>

<p>But Lord Raglan himself gave several instances of
great coolness under fire. He was sitting on horseback
during the Battle of Inkermann, in the midst of a battery
of artillery, watching our men working the guns. A very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
heavy fire was being directed against this part of the
field, and one of his staff suggested the propriety of his
not putting himself in quite so dangerous and conspicuous
a place, especially as, from the number of bullets that
came singing by, it was clear he was being made a mark
for the enemy’s riflemen.</p>

<p>Lord Raglan, however, merely said: “Yes, they seem
firing at us a little; but I think I get a better view here
than in most places.”</p>

<p>So there he remained for some time, and then, turning
his horse, rode along the whole length of the ridge at a
foot’s pace. Some of the hangers-on about the staff
found they had business elsewhere, and cantered unobtrusively
away.</p>

<p>Towards evening of the same day Lord Raglan was
returning from taking his last leave of General Strangways,
who had been mortally wounded, and was riding
up towards the ridge. A sergeant of the 7th Fusiliers
approached, carrying canteens of water to take up for
the wounded. As Lord Raglan passed, he drew himself up
to make the usual salute, when a round shot came bounding
over the hill and knocked his forage-cap off his head.</p>

<p>The man calmly picked up his cap, dusted it on his
knee, placed it carefully on his head, and then made the
military salute, all without moving a muscle of his
countenance. Lord Raglan was delighted with the
sergeant’s coolness, and, smiling, said to him: “A near
thing that, my man!”</p>

<p>“Yes, my lord,” replied the sergeant, with another
salute; “but a miss is as good as a mile.”</p>

<p>One of the most painful things during the battle was
the number of wounded horses. Some of the poor creatures
went grazing about the fields, limping on three
legs, one, perhaps, having been broken or carried away
by a shot. Others were galloping about wildly, scream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>ing
with terror and fright. At times two or three horses
would attach themselves to the staff, as if desirous of
company or for human protection. One poor beast, who
had its nose and mouth shot away, used to edge in
amongst the staff and rub its gory head against their
horses’ flanks. He was at last ordered to be put out
of his pain, being in this more fortunate than many poor
soldiers, who lay out for several nights in their agony.</p>

<p>It was a day or two after that the best shot in the
British Army was killed. Lieutenant Tryon, of the Rifle
Brigade, was shot through the head when in the act of
firing at the retreating Russians. He was a great loss,
much beloved by his men. It is stated that he had himself
killed over a hundred Russians. At the Battle of
Inkermann he employed himself the whole day in firing
at the Russian artillerymen. He had two of his men to
load for him, and they say that he knocked over thirty
Russians, besides wounding several more.</p>

<p>General Canrobert issued a general order eulogizing
the conduct of our Rifles, and lamenting in just terms the
death of Lieutenant Tryon.</p>

<p>This must be the first occasion on record of a French
General particularizing the bravery of a British officer
of Tryon’s rank.</p>

<p>There is a story told which proves that Russian
Generals were not dead to a sense of humour.</p>

<p>A Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;, an officer in an English regiment, was taken
prisoner in a sortie of the Russians, and was sent on to
Simferopol. A day or two after his arrival there he received
some letters from England which had been sent in with a
flag of truce. One of these letters was from a young lady
who was engaged to Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;. In this letter she wrote:</p>

<p>“I hope, dearest, that if you take Prince Menchikoff
prisoner, you will cut a button off his coat and send it to
me in a letter, as you know how fond I am of relics.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>All these letters had been opened and translated at the
Russian headquarters, as is usual. Prince Menchikoff
was shown this letter, which amused him not a little; so
he wrote to Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;, saying how much he regretted he
was unable to pose as a prisoner, when it was the other
way about; but he had much pleasure in sending him the
enclosed button off his best coat, which he trusted
Mr. C&mdash;&mdash; would forward to the young lady with his
compliments.</p>

<p>By December the whole army was suffering, worn out
by night work, by vigil in rain and storm, by hard labour
in the trenches, by cholera and short allowances. For
nine days there was no issue of tea, coffee, or sugar to the
troops. Food, corn, hay were stowed in sailing-vessels
outside the harbour. A hurricane arose. To the bottom
went provender and food for twenty days of all the
horses. You could hardly tell an officer from a corporal.
They were all hairy and muddy, filthy, worn, mounted
on draggle-tailed ponies. Yet withal we are told they
were the noblest, cheeriest, bravest fellows in Europe&mdash;ready
to defy privation, neglect, storm, and wounds.
Letters, it is true, sometimes came from the Crimea in
which the writer showed a righteous indignation against
those who mismanaged affairs and caused so much unnecessary
loss and suffering. In one of these we read:</p>

<p>“<i>January 2.</i>&mdash;We have had a rough and dreary
Christmas. Where are our presents? where are the fat
bucks, the potted meats, the cakes, the warm clothing,
the worsted devices made by the fair sympathizers at
home? They may be on their way, but they will be
too late. Why are our men still in tents? Where are
the huts that were sent out? Some of them I have seen
floating about the beach; others are being converted into
firewood. There are 3,500 sick men in camp; there are
8,000 sick and wounded in the hospitals on the Bosphorus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>“Snow is on the hills, and the wind blows cold. We
have no greatcoats. Our friends the Zouaves are
splendid fellows, always gay, healthy, well fed. They
carry loads for us, drink for us, eat for us, bake for us,
forage for us&mdash;and all on the cheapest and most economical
terms.</p>

<p>“The trenches are two and three feet deep with mud,
snow, and slush. Many men, when they take off their
shoes, are unable to get their swollen feet into them
again. The other day I was riding through the French
camp, 5th Regiment, when an officer came up and invited
me to take a glass of the brandy which had been
sent out by the Emperor as a Christmas gift. He had
a bright wood fire burning in his snug warm pit. Our
presents have so far all miscarried.</p>

<p>“<i>January 19.</i>&mdash;After frost and snow milder weather.
Our warm clothing has come! Many thousands of fine
coats, lined with fur and skins, have been served out to
the men, together with long boots, gloves, socks, and mits.</p>

<p>“What a harvest Death has reaped! How many are
crippled by the cold!</p>

<p>“<i>January 24.</i>&mdash;I have been viewing Sebastopol from
a hill. The suburbs are in ruins. All the streets I saw
had their houses broken down. Roofs, doors, and windows
were all off, but the Russian riflemen shoot from
them. I saw many walking from the sea with baskets
of provisions. The harbour is covered with boats.</p>

<p>“<i>May 18.</i>&mdash;The Sardinians are encamped on the slopes
of pleasant hills. Their tents are upheld by their lances,
one at each end of the tent. Their encampment, with
its waving pennons, has a very pretty effect. The Sardinians’
horses are rather leggy, but not such formidable
neighbours as the horses of the 10th Hussars, which are
the terror of the camp, breaking their picket-ropes and
tearing about madly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yesterday I was riding peaceably along with an
officer of artillery and of 8th Hussars, when suddenly
we heard cries of ‘Look out!’ and lo! there came a furious
steed down upon us, his mane and tail erect. He had
stepped out of a mob of Hussar horses to offer us battle,
and rushed at full gallop towards our ponies.</p>

<p>“‘Out swords!’ was the word, as the interesting beast
circled round us, now menacing us with his heels, now
with his teeth; but he was repelled by two bright swords
and one strong whip, and at last, to our relief, he caught
sight of Colonel Mayo, who was then cantering by in
ignorance of his danger, till he was warned by the shouts
of the soldiers. The Colonel defended himself and horse
with great resolution, and, drawing his sword, gave
point or cut right and left as the case required, till the
men of the 10th came up and beat off the creature. It
is rather too exciting this hot weather to have to run the
risk of being demolished by the heels of an insane Arab.</p>

<p>“<i>June 7.</i>&mdash;It has leaked out that something of import
was to take place to-day. Between 5 and 6 p.m. Lord
Raglan and his staff took up a conspicuous position
looking straight into the teeth of the Redan. The man
with the signal rockets was in attendance. About half-past
six the French attacking column was seen to be
climbing the arduous road to the Mamelon fort.</p>

<p>“The rocket was fired, and our small force rushed for
the quarries to divert the Russians. The French went
up the steep to the Mamelon in beautiful style and in
loose order. Their figures, like light shadows flitting
across the dun barrier of earthworks, were seen to mount
up unfailingly in the evening light&mdash;seen running, climbing,
scrambling like skirmishers up the slopes amid a
plunging fire from the guns.</p>

<p>“As an officer who saw Bosquet wave them on
said at the moment, ‘They went in like a clever pack of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
hounds.’ Then we see the Zouaves standing upon the
parapets and firing down into the fort from above. Now
they are in the heart of the Mamelon, and a fierce hand-to-hand
encounter, with musket and bayonet, is evidently
taking place. It was only seven minutes and a half from
the commencement of the enterprise. There is still
another sharp bayonet fight, and this time the Russians
run out on the other side, spiking their guns. But the
roar of guns is heard on the side towards the town: the
Russians have been reinforced!</p>

<p>“When rocket after rocket went up ominously from
the French General’s position we began to be nervous.
It was growing darker, and the noise of the fight seemed
to be on our side of the fort. At last the swell and babble
of the fight once more rolled down the face of the hill.
‘They are well into it this time,’ said a General, handing
over his glass to his neighbour. All was still. No more
musket flashes, no more lightning of the heavy guns from
the embrasures. A shapeless hump upon a hill, the
Mamelon was an extinct volcano, until such time as
we should please to call it again into action.</p>

<p>“‘How are our men getting on?’ says one.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, take my word for it they’re all right,’ says
another.</p>

<p>“They were in the quarries, but had to fight all night
and repel six successive attacks of the Russians, who
displayed the most singular pertinacity and recklessness
of life. Meanwhile the Zouaves, emboldened by success,
carried their prowess too far, and dreamt of getting
into the round tower by a <i>coup de main</i>. The fire of
the musketry from the round tower was like a shelf of
flame, and the shells of our gunners&mdash;for we were supporting
the French&mdash;stood out dark against the heavens
as they rose and swooped to their fall.</p>

<p>“<i>June 9.</i>&mdash;As an illustration of character I note that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
one of our sailor artillerymen, being desired to keep under
cover and not put his head out to tempt a rifle bullet,
grumbled at the prohibition, saying to his comrades:
‘I say, Jack, they won’t let a fellow go and look where
his own shot is. We ain’t afraid, we ain’t. That’s what
I call hard lines.’</p>

<p>“Lance-Corporal Quin, of the 47th, has been brought
to notice for bravery. In one of the attacks made by
the enemy on the quarries the Russians had some
difficulty in bringing their men again to the scratch.
At length one Russian officer succeeded in bringing on
four men, which Corporal Quin perceiving, he made a
dash out of the work, and with the butt-end of his
musket brained one, bayoneted a second, and when the
other two took to their heels he brought in the officer
as a prisoner, having administered to him a gentle prick
by way of quickening his movements.</p>

<p>“After delivering him up he said to his comrades:
‘There’s plenty more yonder, lads, if so be you’ve a mind
to fetch in a prisoner or two.’</p>

<p>“<i>June 20.</i>&mdash;A plan of attack was proposed&mdash;that the
French were to assault the Malakoff and we the Redan;
but though they got into the Malakoff, they were driven
out again, with loss. As our 37th Regiment advanced
they were met by a well-aimed fire of mitraille, which
threw them into disorder.</p>

<p>“Poor Colonel Zea in vain tried to steady them, exclaiming:
‘This will never do! Where’s the bugler to
call them back?’</p>

<p>“But at that moment no bugler was to be found. In
the gloom of early dawn the gallant old soldier by voice
and gesture tried to reform his men, but as he ran to the
head of the column a charge of the deadly missle passed,
and he fell dead. Next day we had to ask for an armistice
to bury our dead, which was not granted until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
4 p.m. It was agonizing to see the wounded men who
were lying out under a broiling sun, to behold them waving
their caps or hands faintly towards our lines, over which
they could see the white flag waving, and not to be able
to help them. Many of them had lain there for thirty hours.</p>

<p>“As I was riding round I came upon two of our men
with sad faces.</p>

<p>“‘What are you waiting here for?’ said I.</p>

<p>“‘To go out for the Colonel, sir,’ was the reply.</p>

<p>“‘What Colonel?’</p>

<p>“‘Why, Colonel Zea, to be sure, sir,’ said the good
fellow, evidently surprised at my thinking there could
be any other Colonel in the world.</p>

<p>“Ah! they liked him well. Under a brusque manner
he concealed a most kind heart, and a soldier more
devoted to his men and to his country never fell in battle.
The Fusiliers were the first who had hospital huts. When
other regiments were in need of every comfort Zea’s
regiment had all that exertion and foresight could procure.
I ride on, and find two Voltigeurs with a young
English naval officer between them. They are taking
him off to shoot him as a spy. He has not enough French
to explain his position to his captors.</p>

<p>“‘He tells us he is an officer of the <i>Viper</i>, that he got
into the Mamelon by mistake.’ The matter is explained
to our allies, who let him go with the best grace in the
world. As to the attack which failed, we are disappointed,
yet we do not despair; but we learn now that
we are going to attack the Redan and Malakoff by sap
and mine&mdash;a tedious process of many weeks.</p>

harbour. The Crimean War is over!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />
<span class="smaller">THE INDIAN MUTINY&mdash;DELHI (1857-1858)</span></h2>

<p class="summary">The Mutiny begins&mdash;A warning from a sepoy&mdash;A near thing&mdash;A noble
act of a native officer&mdash;In camp at Delhi with no kit&mdash;A plan that
failed&mdash;Our first check&mdash;Wilson in command&mdash;Seaton wounded&mdash;Arrival
of Nicholson&mdash;Captures guns&mdash;The assault&mdash;The fate of
the Princes&mdash;Pandy in a box.</p>

<p>A rumour had been going through the bazaars of India
that the British rule was to be limited to one hundred
years from the date of the Battle of Plassey (1757). The
sepoy troops had grown self-confident and arrogant
through the victories they had won under English officers,
and fancied that they held the destiny of India in their
own hands. Then came the story that the cartridges
of the new Enfield rifles, which were just then being
introduced among the native troops, were greased with
fat of beef or pork, and were thus rendered unclean for
Mohammedan and Hindoo alike. The sepoys, or native
troops, believed that the new cartridges were being given
out solely for the purpose of destroying their caste, and
so of introducing Christianity by force.</p>

<p>Delhi, where the deposed King Bahadur Shah was
living, was the centre and focus of rebellion; it was to
Delhi that the first mutineers marched after killing their
English officers. Sir Thomas Seaton has left us some
picturesque stories of his part in the Mutiny. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
rejoined his native regiment at Rohtuck, forty-five miles
from Delhi, after some years’ leave in England, and
found the manners of the sepoy greatly changed for the
worse. He writes:</p>

<p>“On the 4th of June I was in the mess-tent writing
to the Adjutant-General about the hopeless state of the
regiment, when the native Adjutant came in and
said:</p>

<p>“‘Colonel, I wish particularly to speak to you.’</p>

<p>“It was close upon 5 p.m., and, as several officers were
in the tent, I went outside with the Adjutant.</p>

<p>“‘Well, Shebbeare, what is it?’</p>

<p>“‘Why, Colonel, I have just heard from two of our
drummers, who have their information from friends
amongst the men, that the regiment is to mutiny to-night,
murder the officers, and be off to Delhi.’</p>

<p>“Though I expected this, it was startling enough to
hear it was so close at hand. And now that the great
difficulty stared me in the face, how, with this small body
of officers, was I to meet and grapple with reckless and
determined mutineers? But as this was not the time
to flinch or show indecision, I said:</p>

<p>“‘Well, Shebbeare, let me see the men. I’ll make
a few inquiries first. I will go to the hospital. Do you
lounge out that way too.’</p>

<p>“As I had been used to visit the hospital about this
hour, my going there would excite no suspicion.</p>

<p>“In a few minutes I had found out that it was too
true that an outbreak was planned for that night. Meanwhile
I addressed the Adjutant:</p>

<p>“‘Now, Shebbeare, will you stand by me?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, Colonel,’ replied the gallant fellow, ‘that I
will.’</p>

<p>“‘Very well. Now, I’ll tell you what I propose to
do. I will go on parade, and, as there is nothing like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
facing a difficulty, I’ll tax them with their intended
outbreak, and we will see what they will do. Tell the
officers to look out.’”</p>

<p>Seaton’s idea was that the men, finding he knew all
about their plans, would be so disconcerted that they
would put off the mutiny; we should probably gain a
day or two of delay, and might hear that Delhi was taken
or the mutineers defeated. So at sunset he went on
parade, assembled the native officers in front, at some
distance from their companies, and taxed them with
their intended treachery. As he had expected, the sepoys
were utterly confounded; they flatly denied the intended
treachery, and swore by all their gods that they would
be faithful to their salt, and that no harm should happen
to the officers.</p>

<p>The native officers then begged permission to appoint
a guard to keep watch in the camp at night, as there
might be some <i>badmashes</i> in the regiment.</p>

<p>It was a dangerous experiment, but the only chance
was to take things coolly, still seeming to trust the men,
keeping at the same time a sharp look-out.</p>

<p>It was Seaton’s duty to keep the regiment together as
long as possible at any risk. The Commander-in-Chief
was marching on Delhi with a small force hurriedly got
together; to have placed at this critical moment a regiment
of mutineers in his rear would simply have been
destruction, for they could have fortified some spot on
the road and so cut off supplies from our camp.</p>

<p>Whilst he was taxing the native officers, the men of
their companies were looking on&mdash;they were too far off
to hear; but they took their cue from their officers and
were quiet and respectful. Seaton left the circle of native
officers, and went up and addressed each company,
meeting with the same vows of fidelity.</p>

<p>As he came from parade after this trying scene, some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
officers inquired anxiously: “What is it, Colonel? Is it
all right?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes. I think our throats will not be cut to-night.”</p>

<p>But his mind was not at ease until he had seen the
guard for the night.</p>

<p>However, a few days passed quietly enough; but on
the 8th a curious thing happened. As Seaton was going
in the evening to visit the hospital, and was crossing a
ditch, a young sepoy gave him a hand and whispered in
his ear:</p>

<p>“Colonel Sahib, when your highness’ people shall have
regained the Empire, I will make my petition to your
highness.”</p>

<p>This was all he said, but Seaton could not help pondering
on his meaning. Was this a warning to him of the coming
outbreak of the regiment?</p>

<p>Resistance was out of the question, as he had only
twelve English officers with him and one English sergeant.
He was tormented by the ever-recurring thought that not
only the lives of his officers, but perhaps the safety of
our little army, might be dependent on himself. “All I
could do,” he says, “was to trust in God’s mercy and
goodness.”</p>

<p>The night of the 9th passed off quietly&mdash;all was still.
In the morning he could detect nothing suspicious in camp.
The men were civil and respectful to him personally.
Some were parading for guard, some going to bathe,
others preparing their food. Five of the young officers
asked leave to go out shooting. Seaton had no
objection, and they went. At 4 p.m., when he was in
the usual camp hot-weather deshabille, all at once he was
startled by a loud explosion. He ran out to see what
was the matter, but neither saw nor heard anything
strange&mdash;no crowd, not a sound, the men mostly sleeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
after their day’s meal. He was going on when the
havildar-major (native sergeant-major) came rushing up
to him. Catching him in his arms, he said in a very
agitated voice:</p>

<p>“Colonel Sahib, don’t go to the front.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“The Grenadiers are arming themselves. They have
mutinied!”</p>

<p>The hour for which he had trembled had come at last.
He tried to collect one or two of the native officers, but
in vain. The havildar-major entreated him to be off
whilst there was time. While the grooms were saddling
the horses they heard musket-shots, and the havildar
rushed past him. Immediately the whole body of the
Grenadiers burst out of their tents, firing and shouting,
in order to rouse the regiment and hurry it into mutiny.</p>

<p>The shouts and cries of terror, the galloping of horses,
the report of muskets, all tended to confusion. Seaton
had not time to take his sword, for the mutineers were
within ten paces of him. He had got a few seconds’
start, and in a mêlée like this a second makes all the
difference between life and eternity.</p>

<p>Just outside camp they overtook Major Drought, who
was walking.</p>

<p>The havildar instantly cried: “Colonel, the poor old
fellow will be murdered. I’ll put him on my horse
and run for it.”</p>

<p>It was a noble and heroic act, for Shebbeare had been
wounded by the mutineers. So they made Shebbeare
get on the lee side of the Colonel’s horse; he laid hold of
the stirrup, and off they went at a round canter.</p>

<p>After running 400 yards he got blown, and they pulled
up to a walk. Soon they found the officers waiting for
them at a bend in the road; they were all unhurt. After
a time they saw clouds of smoke ascending, and knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
that they were burning the tents. They kept on all
night at a moderate pace. About 3 a.m. they heard a
horseman coming along. Who could it be? They drew
up and challenged.</p>

<p>“Who is there?”</p>

<p>“Sowar” (trooper).</p>

<p>“What sowar?”</p>

<p>“Hodson Sahib Ka Sowar” (one of Captain Hodson’s
troopers). And then, saluting, he continued: “Are you
the Sahib log? I have a letter for Colonel Cheetun
Sahib.”</p>

<p>“Yes, come along; here is the Colonel Seaton.”</p>

<p>Seaton read the note by the light of a cigar vehemently
smoked by an officer. It was to the effect that we had
driven the rebels from the ridge into Delhi, and that our
camp was pitched in the cantonments. So now they
were all right, and knew where to find their camp. At
9 a.m. the Colonel dismounted at Sir H. Barnard’s tent.</p>

<p>They were all surprised to see him, as they had been
informed that he and his officers were all killed: the young
officers who had gone out shooting had been so informed,
and had ridden to Delhi before them with the news.</p>

<p>Now all the belongings the Colonel had were his horse
and the few clothes he stood in. He had to go round
camp and beg: one gave him a coat, a shirt, and some
cigars, another a sword and belt. He was made a member
of the mess of the 1st E. B. Fusiliers, but had neither
fork, spoon, plate, nor glass&mdash;for the mess merely provides
food and dishes. However, he soon begged these
or bought all he needed at a sale of an officer’s effects.</p>

<p>“My first night’s rest was heavenly,” he says. “I
heard distinctly the firing, but it did not disturb me.
I was lulled by a feeling of security to which I had been
a stranger for many nights before the 60th mutinied.
No wonder my sleep was profound.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>Delhi is situated on the right bank of the river Jumna.
The walls are pear-shaped, on the river or eastern side
rendered irregular by the excrescence of the old fort of
Selimgurh. To the south the walls run to a point. Inland
from Delhi is a ridge of rocks, which at its nearest point
is about 1,400 yards from the walls. Our camp lay under
the ridge, on the side away from the city; there were
canals and swamps to protect us in rainy seasons. It
was quite evident that a regular siege was out of the
question, from the vast size of the place and from our
want of guns, etc. A <i>coup de main</i> was our only resource.
Accordingly a plan was drawn up by the Engineers and
Hodson, and approved by the General. It was a
hazardous step, but one and all were crying out “Take
Delhi!”</p>

<p>Nor was this cry to be wondered at. Delhi, once the
capital of the great Mogul Empire in India, strongly
fortified, and supplied with war material, was now in
the possession of our own trained sepoys. The King,
once our puppet, had placed himself at the head of the
rebellion, and Delhi had become the focus of insurrection.</p>

<p>Moreover, there was a vehement desire in camp for
instant vengeance on the traitors in the city, who had
cruelly murdered their officers, our brethren in arms,
with their wives and little ones. One bold stroke now,
every one said, would make us masters of Delhi. At the
appointed hour the troops began to move down to their
allotted posts.</p>

<p>All were waiting impatiently for the pickets from the
ridge, but the proper time slipped by, and the assault
was countermanded.</p>

<p>The storm of indignation in camp at the failure of this
bold design was frightful. But, as Colonel Norman justly
remarked, “It was one of those happy interpositions in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
our behalf of which we had such numbers to be thankful
for.”</p>

<p>For, even if the rebels should have been driven out of
Delhi, what if they rallied and returned in force? Our
poor 3,000 men would have been swallowed up in the
immensity of the city. The postponement of the assault
gave the rebels full scope: it bred anarchy, confusion,
and disorder, and the native trading population soon
felt the difference between the violence and robbery of
the sepoy domination and the peace and security they had
enjoyed under us. But in camp the abandonment of the
assault was followed by a period of despondency and gloom.</p>

<p>In a few days cheering news came from the Punjab.
The Chief Commissioner, John Lawrence, aided by worthy
officers, had made all safe at the chief points of danger.
All through the Punjab the Hindoo cavalry and sepoys
were being disarmed; the magazines had been secured;
the Sikhs and Punjabees, men who had no sympathy
with the mutineers, were being enrolled and formed into
corps and re-armed. With bold and daring hand, that
“out of this nettle, danger, plucks the flower safety,”
Lawrence was gathering as volunteers from the warlike
frontier tribes all the restless, turbulent spirits who might
have been bitter foes in extremity. He took them into
pay, and made them eager to march on Delhi, to assist
in its capture and share in its plunder.</p>

<p>There were several sorties to repulse, and these small
successes kept up the men’s spirits. In the first six
weeks of the siege, or until the reinforcements began to
flow in, night or day no man undressed, except for a
few minutes for the necessary ablutions and changes of
clothes, and this was not always possible. They lay down
and slept in their clothes, with arms and ammunition
either on or by their sides, ready to slip on the moment
the alarm should be sounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>The heat was fearful, yet day after day they had to
stand for hours in the sun and hot wind, or, worst of all,
to endure the torture of lying down on the burning rocks
on the Ridge&mdash;baked by them on one side, whilst the sun
was “doing” the other. Many an officer and man,
struck by the sun and unable to rise, was carried off to
hospital delirious and raving. The flies were in myriads,
and added to their torments; they clung to hands and
faces, they covered the food until it was uneatable,
and they worried all incessantly until dusk. Many men
had sunstroke twice; some who were wounded suffered
from it also, and the great heat and fatigue began to tell
on the soldiers, and sent them into hospital, from whence
many were never to return.</p>

<p>Fortunately, food in camp was both abundant and
good; the troops got their meals and their dram of grog
with great regularity.</p>

<p>It was quite amusing to see the cook-boys of companies
bring up the dinners to their respective squads. Battery
or advanced picket, it was all the same to them; cannonade
or no cannonade&mdash;it made no difference, they were sure
to come.</p>

<p>A large flat shallow basket held twenty or more metal
plates; on each a piece of beef and some nicely browned
potatoes, all smoking and frizzling from a few bits of
live charcoal in a small earthen pan under each.</p>

<p>On the 18th, the 15th and 30th Native Infantry, with
the famous Jellalabad battery&mdash;Abbott’s battery that was&mdash;marched
into Delhi, to the great joy of the mutineers
and the King.</p>

<p>At noon on the 19th the rebels began to pour out of
Delhi in great numbers. The alarm was sounded, and
in a few minutes every one was at his post; but as no enemy
appeared, the troops were allowed to return to their
tents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>A gun fired in their rear startled the English; then
galloped up a trooper to say that the Pandies (as they
called the rebels) were killing the grass-cutters and
carrying off the cattle. Then troops were sent out, and
fighting went on long after dusk. The casualty list was
heavy: a limber of Scott’s battery was blown up, while
one of Turner’s guns was disabled and left on the field.
“I well remember the gloomy impression which the
result of this fight made on our minds. It was our first
check.”</p>

<p>Next morning a strong party was sent out to the scene
of action. To their great surprise, there was Turner’s
gun; there also a gun and two ammunition waggons
abandoned by the rebels. There were so many evidences
on the field that the enemy had suffered severely that
all gloom and despondency were quite relieved.</p>

<p>This was the most trying period of the whole siege.
If an officer sat down to write a letter or to shave himself
the alarm was sure to sound, and he was compelled to
throw down his pen or razor, buckle on his sword, and
rush out to his post.</p>

<p>The 23rd of June was the centenary of the Battle of
Plassey, and their spies told the English officers they were
to be attacked at all points. They began to fight at
sunrise, and, strange to say, in the very height of the
mêlée our first reinforcements marched into camp! Three
times the rebels assaulted our position, each time being
repulsed with great loss. “We drove them back, and
then we began a series of attacks on houses, gardens and
enclosures filled with mutineers, whom we cleared out;
our heavy guns hastened or retarded their flight into the
city.</p>

<p>“I look upon this day as the turning-point in the
siege: our first reinforcements had come in, and we had
gained an important victory over the rebels.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon was seen a great smoke beyond Delhi: they were
burning their dead!</p>

<p>“Of the many interpositions of a merciful Providence
in our behalf during this wonderful siege,” says Seaton,
“I think the most striking was this&mdash;that the rains
were so abundant and the season so favourable that
cholera was in a comparatively mild form. The rains
filled the Jumna on one side and the canal on the other,
thus forming, as it were, a wall to the right and left of
our road to the Punjab, guarding it more effectually than
many thousand men could have done.”</p>

<p>During the night of the 4th it rained in torrents.
Colonel Seaton was driven into the Flagstaff Tower
for shelter, but could only get standing room, so he
went and visited the pickets, and sentries, and returned
soaked through and through. He then lighted a cigar
and stood about till daylight, when the picket turned out
and he turned in and slept till sunrise.</p>

<p>At sunrise he was relieved, after thirty-six hours on
duty. On getting into camp he found his own tent
pitched, his servants all waiting, clean clothes, washing
tackle, a clean breakfast table, and Hodson, with a smiling
face, waiting for him.</p>

<p>“We felt like men who had just inherited large
fortunes! My things had been sent on from Alipore.
Oh! it was a comfort to get my own clothes and uniform,
to be able to appear in camp once more dressed like a
gentleman, and to have the attendance of my own
servant.”</p>

<p>On the night of the 5th of July General Sir H. Barnard
died of cholera, brought on by fatigue and anxiety of
mind.</p>

<p>General Wilson began on a new system. They no longer
attacked the villages, losing men and gaining little. They
were now to remain on the defensive, and to burn or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
bury all corpses. For it was sickening to see the dogs
and jackals, disturbed by the burying-parties, slowly
waddling off, fat and gorged with their horrible feast.</p>

<p>Until buried the rebels were still enemies: their effluvia
carried death into our ranks. As a sergeant once said:
“Them Pandies, sir, is wuss when they are killed.”</p>

<p>On the 19th they received the first intelligence of
the Cawnpore tragedy&mdash;of Wheeler’s capitulation and
destruction&mdash;causing great depression in camp and more
cholera.</p>

<p>They had been clearing the gardens of rebels beyond
the Metcalfe grounds when Seaton saw two of Coke’s
men coming along, carrying Captain Law, who had just
been killed. He stopped to help them, and was stooping
to take the men’s muskets when he was struck full on
the left breast by a musket-ball fired at thirty-five paces’
distance. The blow was so violent that he was nearly
knocked off his horse, and for some seconds could not
breathe, the blood rushing from his mouth in foam.
He naturally thought he was done for, but as soon as
his breath came again, he opened his clothes and found out
the course of the ball.</p>

<p>Seeing that no air issued from the wound, he secured his
sword and pistol, and, dismounting from his horse, led
him over a broken wall, and was on the point of falling
headlong in a faint when the two men he had tried to
help took him under the arms and got him to the Metcalfe
picket.</p>

<p>The men there ran to meet him: one gave him a drop
of rum and water, others brought a <i>charpoy</i> (native
bedstead) and carried him off to the doctor. On the
way he met Hodson, who galloped off at once to camp,
so when they reached his tent, he found the doctor waiting
and everything ready. The ball had struck on a rib,
fractured it, driven it down on the lung, and then had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
passed out at his back. Hodson cared for him with the
affection of a brother. He was to lie quite still and not
speak for a week.</p>

<p>On the 1st of August the doctor took off this embargo&mdash;Seaton
was recovering rapidly. In Delhi, our spies said,
the Pandies were all jealous of one another and would
not act in concert. The rebel sepoy carried in a purse
round his waist the gold he had made by selling his
share of our plundered treasures; this gold made him
unwilling to risk his life in battle and made him suspect
his comrades.</p>

<p>Their wounded were in a horrible state: there were
no surgeons to perform any operations, no attendants
to bring food or water. The limbs of some were rotting
off with gangrene, others had wounds filled with maggots
from neglect; all were bitterly contrasting their lot with
the life of comfort they had enjoyed under British government.
The old King, too, was in despair, and vented
it in some poor poetry.</p>

<p>On the 7th of August there was a tremendous explosion
in the city, and next day they heard that a powder manufactory
had blown up, killing 400 people.</p>

<p>“About this time”&mdash;to quote the words of one who
wrote a history of this siege&mdash;“a stranger of very striking
appearance was remarked visiting all our pickets, examining
everything, making most searching inquiries about
their strength and history. His attire gave no clue to
his rank; it evidently never gave the owner a thought.
He was a man cast in a giant mould, with massive chest
and powerful limbs, and an expression ardent and commanding,
with a dash of roughness, features of stern
beauty, a long black beard, and deep, sonorous voice.
There was something of immense strength, talent, and
resolution in his whole gait and manner, and a power of
ruling men on high occasions that no one could escape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
noticing at once. His imperial air, which never left him,
and which would have been thought arrogant in one of less
imposing mien, sometimes gave offence to his own countrymen,
but made him almost worshipped by the pliant
Asiatics. Such a man would have risen rapidly from the
ranks of the legions to the throne of the Cæsars; but in
the service of the British it was thought wonderful that
he became a Brigadier-General when, by seniority, he
could only have been a Captain.”</p>

<p>The stranger thus described was Nicholson, the best
man that Sir John Lawrence possessed in the Punjab.
He had ridden ahead of his force to consult with General
Wilson before Delhi. On the following day he returned
to his force, On the 14th he again rode into the English
camp at the head of his column&mdash;a splendid addition of
4,200 men to the besiegers. The small force upon the
ridge now amounted to 8,000 men of all arms; the siege-train
was on its way, and despair began to settle down
on the rebels in the city and on the Princes.</p>

<p>They had heard of the defeat of the Nana, and of
Havelock’s entry into Cawnpore; they knew that fresh
troops were coming from Calcutta, and that Nicholson,
whose name had spread far and wide, had arrived in our
camp with a large force. They knew, too, that this
compact force of white men was swayed by one arm and
governed by one will. Every soul in Delhi knew that
John Lawrence directed the storm that was gathering
around them, and the cold, dread shadow of the coming
event was creeping over the shuddering city. A look
through our camp would have shaken the courage of the
boldest rebel. Instead of tents half filled with sick men,
our camp now was teeming with soldiers of various races,
all cheerful and confident. Hodson’s men were mostly
Sikhs, tall and slender, yet wiry and strong; their
clothes of ash colour, with wrist-band, turban, and sash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
over the left shoulder, all of bright crimson. In contrast
with these were Coke’s men, more wild and picturesque,
with large turbans of dark blue and enormous waist-bands.
Their lofty stature, long hair, bright black
eyes, sandalled feet, and bold look, would have made them
remarkable anywhere.</p>

<p>Our artillery park, too, was filled with guns captured
from the mutineers. The battery-train was on its way,
but it was reported by spies that a very strong body of
rebels was about to leave the city to attempt its capture.
Nicholson was sent out with 700 cavalry and 1,200
infantry, and three troops of horse artillery, to head them
off. He returned in triumph, bringing with him thirteen
captured guns. In Nicholson’s fight the following
incident occurred, which shows a little bit of the native
character:</p>

<p>A rebel native officer was overtaken in his flight
from the field by a man of Green’s Punjab regiment.
The officer immediately went down on his knees in the
midst of a pool of water, and putting up his hands, roared
out: “I’ve been forty years in the Company’s service,
and thirteen years a Subadar. Spare&mdash;oh, spare my life!”
With an execration and a very rude term of abuse the
Punjabee thrust his bayonet into the traitor.</p>

<p>On the 4th of September the long-expected battery-train
arrived in camp, with an ample supply of shot,
shell, and powder for all the guns.</p>

<p>The activity in the Engineers’ camp was now pushed
to the utmost, and all the material for trenches and batteries
was accumulated with great rapidity.</p>

<p>To prevent the men plundering, the General promised
that all the captured property should be prize, and prize
agents were appointed.</p>

<p>We were about to throw a small force of about 4,500
men into a city seven miles in circumference, a perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
maze of narrow streets and gullies, abounding in strong
blocks of houses, where one might expect that the defence
would be obstinate.</p>

<p>On the night of the 7th 1,300 men in working and
covering parties were sent down with the Engineers to
open trenches and erect the first siege-battery against
Delhi. On the 12th the whole of the batteries were
completed, and in full play on the parts of the walls
intended to be breached or shelled. The parapet was
soon knocked off, each block of masonry rarely requiring
more than two well-planted shots to demolish it completely.
There was outside the wall a ditch 25 feet
wide and 16 feet deep, before crossing which it was
necessary that all the parapets and bastions should be
cleared of their defenders. The army inside Delhi
numbered at least 40,000 men; the besiegers only 11,000,
after all their reinforcements had come in. Of these
only 3,300 were Europeans. Our heavy guns were
54 in number, while those in the city amounted to 300.</p>

<p>There was considerable risk in attempting to storm
under such conditions. One of the batteries was only
160 yards from the Water Bastion, and the heavy guns
had to be dragged up to it, through the open, under a
heavy fire of musketry. Baird Smith, the Chief Engineer,
prepared all the plans; Alexander Taylor superintended
their execution. With the very first shot the masonry
of the fortifications began to fly. Fifty-four guns and
mortars belched out havoc on the city. Cheers rang out
from our men as the smoke cleared away, and they saw
the dreaded bastions crumbling into ruins, while the
defenders were forced to seek shelter far away in the city.
For the next forty-eight hours there was no cessation of
the roar of artillery. The worn-out gunners would throw
themselves down to snatch a short sleep beneath their
very guns, while volunteers filled their place; then, spring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>ing
up again, they would go on with their task with fresh
ardour.</p>

<p>The sepoys were fighting on with the courage of despair.
They ran out light guns to enfilade our batteries; they
manned the gardens in front of the city with sharp-shooters
to pick off our gunners.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 13th the breaches in the walls
were to be examined, and so at dusk Lieutenants
Greathed, Home, Medley, and Lang, of the Engineers,
were sent to execute their dangerous mission. As
the hour struck ten the batteries ceased firing, and the
four young officers, slipping out of the gardens with a
small covering party of the 60th Rifles, crept forward
to the edge of the glacis, Greathed and Home going to
the Water, Medley and Lang to the Cashmere Bastion.
A ladder was quietly lowered, Medley and Lang descended,
and found themselves on the edge of the ditch; but the
enemy heard them, and several ran towards them. The
Englishmen saw that the breach was practicable, so rose
and ran back, being followed by a harmless volley.
Greathed and Home returned safely also, and reported
that all was favourable.</p>

<p>Then was the thrilling order made known: “The
assault at 3 a.m.!”</p>

<p>No. 1. column, under Nicholson, were to assault the
Cashmere Bastion; No. 2, under Colonel James, the Water
Bastion; No. 3, under Colonel Campbell, to enter by the
Cashmere Gate; No. 4, under Major Reid, to attack
Kissengunge.</p>

<p>To Nicholson fell the post of honour. Sir John
Lawrence had sent him down “to take Delhi,” and the
whole army was willing that he should have that honour.
He was to head the first column in person. Our batteries
redoubled their roar whilst the columns were taking up
their positions, throwing shells to drive the enemy away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
from the breaches. The morning was just breaking;
the thunder of our artillery was at its loudest, when all
at once it stopped. Every one could hear his heart beat.</p>

<p>The Rifles now ran forward as skirmishers to cover
the advance of the assaulting columns, and the men,
who had been lying on the ground, now sprang up, and,
with a cheer, made for the walls. They crossed the
glacis, and left it behind them dotted with wounded
men; they went down into the ditch&mdash;many to stay
there; but the ladders were planted against the scarp,
and very soon the dangers of the escalade were over.
Soon the whole line of ramparts which faced the ridge
was ours; the British flag was once more run up upon the
Cabul Gate.</p>

<p>Meanwhile at the Cashmere Gate there had been some
delay. Lieutenants Home and Salkeld, with some sergeants
and native sappers, had at sunrise crossed the
beams of the bridge, from which the rebels had removed
the planking, and in broad daylight, without a particle
of cover, had laid their powder-bags. The enemy were
so daunted by this daring act that, when they saw Home
coming, they hastily shut the wicket, and he and his
men laid the bags and jumped down into the ditch
unhurt.</p>

<p>Salkeld was not so fortunate. The rebels fired on him
from the top of the gateway, and he fell. Sergeant
Burgess caught up the portfire, but was shot dead.
Carmichael fired the fuse, and fell mortally wounded.</p>

<p>Sergeant Smith, finding the fuse was alight, threw
himself into the ditch, and instantly the gate was burst
open with a tremendous crash.</p>

<p class="header">A Daring Deed: Blowing-up the Cashmere Gate, Delhi</p>

<p>In broad daylight, and without a particle of cover, Lieuts. Home and Salkeld, with
a few sappers, laid their powder bags and fired them. Salkeld and some of the others
were shot before they could escape.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The bugler sounded the advance, and with a cheer
our men rushed through the gateway, and met the other
columns, who had carried their respective breaches.
The Lahore Gate alone defied our attempts, and Nicholson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
called for volunteers to follow him through the narrow
street towards the Lahore Gate.</p>

<p>As he strode forward, sword in hand, though there
was death in every window and on every house-top,
his great stature marked him out as a target for the
enemy, and he fell, mortally wounded, the one man
England wanted most.</p>

<p>The long autumn day was over, and we were in Delhi,
but had not taken it. Sixty-six officers and 1,100 men
had fallen, while not a sixth part of the city was ours.
Many of our men were lying drunk in the shops. Had
the sepoys possessed a General, they might have recovered
the ridge, and taken our whole camp, defended
as it was mainly by the sick and wounded.</p>

<p>On the next day, by order of General Wilson, vast
quantities of beer, wine, and brandy were destroyed.
On the 16th active operations were resumed. By
sapping gradually from house to house we managed to
avoid street fighting and slowly pressed the rebels back
into the ever-narrowing part of the city from which, like
rats, they streamed.</p>

<p>Whilst Seaton was in the Cashmere Gateway, he saw
some artillerymen who were on duty there rummaging
about. One of them was looking into a long arm-chest,
when all at once he slammed down the lid, sat upon it
sharp, and roared out: “Hi! Bill, run! be quick! Here’s
a devil of a Pandy in the box!”</p>

<p>Bill lost no time in attending to his comrade’s request,
and others running up to see what it was, they pulled out
of the box a fine powerful sepoy, who was taken at once
to the ditch and disposed of without more ceremony.</p>

<p>On the 18th, between 9 and 10 a.m., there was an
eclipse of the sun. There is little doubt that this had a
great effect on the minds of the superstitious natives,
for they now began to leave the city in streams.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>On the morning of the 20th, as the city in the direction
of the palace seemed to be deserted, Colonel Jones came
down with a column; a powder-bag was applied to the
palace gates, a few defenders were slain, and the British
flag was hoisted.</p>

<p>That night the mess dinner was laid in the celebrated
Dewan Khas, the marble building that Moore describes
in “Lalla Rookh.”</p>

<p>The inner room is the King’s throne-room, and round
the walls, inlaid with black marble, are the famous
words: “If there be an elysium on earth, it is this.”</p>

<p>The habits of the late King and family rendered that
elysium a very dirty one, though the white marble was
inlaid with coloured stones in flowers and arabesques.
The houses and huts in which the Princes of the royal
blood lived with their wives and children were a perfect
rabbit-warren, so closely packed were they. The exterior
walls enclosing the palace are 60 feet high, and built
of red sandstone, loopholed and crenellated, and make a
noble appearance.</p>

<p>But the squalor and filth in the whole place were
inconceivable. As none of the Princes could engage in
any business, the pittance they had to live on barely
supplied the necessaries of life. Seaton saw some of the
Princes. He says: “There was no trace of nobility, either
of birth or of mind, in their faces. They were stamped
with everything vile, gross, ignoble, sensual. Noble
blood is a fine thing, but a noble heart is better, and
will shine through the most forbidding features; but
these wretches, with the cold, calm hand of death on them,
showed nothing of kingly descent or nobility of heart,
their countenances being as forbidding as the despicable
passions in which they had indulged could make them.”</p>

<p>It was laughable to see what rubbish was found in
the palace. In one room were found at least 200 pair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
of those trousers which Mohammedan ladies wear instead
of petticoats. Some of these were so stiff with brocaded
silk that they must have needed a hearty kick with each
foot at every step.</p>

<p>The quantities of pots and pans which they had amassed
would have furnished a whole street of dealers; then, there
were telescopes and guns and other valuables.</p>

<p>Much blame has been cast on Hodson for his severity
to the royal family. He fetched out the King and three
Princes from the tomb where they had taken refuge.
The Princes were in a native carriage, and as they drew
near to Delhi an immense crowd surged round them,
which was increasing every moment, pressing on Hodson’s
few men. They could hardly proceed. Hodson, perhaps
fearing a rescue, ordered the three prisoners to get out.
The poor wretches, seeing that something was about
to happen, put up their hands and fell at his feet, begging
that their lives might be spared.</p>

<p>Hodson merely said, “Choop ruho” (be silent); “take
off your upper garments.” They did so. Then, “Get into
the cart.” They obeyed.</p>

<p>Hodson then took a carbine from one of his men,
and shot them all three. Then, turning to his men, he
said: “These three men whom I have just shot are the
three Princes who contrived and commenced the slaughter
of our innocent women and children, and thus retributive
vengeance has fallen on them.”</p>

<p>The crowd, overawed, parted, and the carriage passed
on. The bodies were exposed on the very spot where
our unfortunate countrymen had been exposed. It
seems cruel and vindictive, but we are judging in security.
Hodson had an angry people to daunt, and their sense of
justice to satisfy.</p>

<p>One must do our soldiers the justice to say that, though
infuriated by the slaughter of their officers and country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>men,
with their wives and children, inflamed by the
news of the Cawnpore massacre, not an old man, not a
woman or child, was wilfully hurt by them. As Seaton
was waiting on the 20th by the Palace Gate, some soldiers
were bringing along an old man, whom they held by the
arms. He went up and said to them: “Remember you
are Christian men, and he is very old.”</p>

<p>“Oh, sir!” was the reply, “we doesn’t forget that. We
don’t mean him no harm. We only wants a bit of
baccy.”</p>

<p>So he let them go on, and in a few minutes saw them
stuffing their pipes, and the old fellow genially bringing
a coal to light them.</p>

<p>“I have seen hundreds of instances where the greatest
humanity and kindness were shown, both to young and
old, as well as to females, by our noble-hearted fellows,
even in their wildest moments.”</p>

<span class="smaller">THE DEFENCE OF LUCKNOW (<span class="smcap">31st of May to 25th of
September, 1857</span>)</span></h2>

<p class="summary">Firing at close quarters&mdash;Adventures of fugitives&mdash;Death of Sir H.
Lawrence&mdash;His character&mdash;Difficulty of sending letters&mdash;Mines
and counter-mines&mdash;Fulton killed&mdash;Signs of the relief coming&mdash;A
great welcome&mdash;Story of the escape from Cawnpore.</p>

<p>For about ten days previous to the outbreak at Lucknow
daily reports were made that an <i>émeute</i> was intended,
and Sir Henry Lawrence, the brother of Sir John Lawrence,
had ordered all kinds of stores to be bought and
stored. The ladies and children had been removed from
the cantonments to the Residency in the city, which was
already occupied by a party of the 32nd foot and two
guns.</p>

<p>The 9 p.m. gun on the 30th of May was evidently the
signal for the mutiny to begin, as a few minutes after
it had been fired, whilst Sir Henry and his staff were at
dinner at the Residency, a sepoy came running in, and
reported a disturbance in the lines.</p>

<p>Sir Henry took two guns and a company of the 32nd,
and took post on the road leading to the town. Meanwhile
bands of insurgents began to plunder and burn our
officers’ bungalows. Many officers had wonderful escapes
from death; some were killed by the rebels. Muchee
Bhawun, the residence of the late King, had been selected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
as a fitting place of security and retreat: it was being
strengthened and supplied with stores.</p>

<p>On <i>June 10</i> houses and buildings around began to be
demolished; tents were set apart for the European
refugees who arrived daily from the districts.</p>

<p>On <i>June 12</i> the military police mutinied in a body,
and went off to Cawnpore; they were pursued for eight
miles and about twenty were killed.</p>

<p>On <i>June 15</i> a hundred barrels of gunpowder were
brought from the Muchee Bhawun and buried in the
Residency enclosure; twenty-three lacs of rupees were
also buried in front of the Residency to save the use of
sentries. Cash payments were now suspended, the men
being paid by promissory notes.</p>

<p>On <i>June 20</i> large stacks of firewood, covered with
earth, were placed to protect the front of the Residency:
they formed an embankment 6 feet high, and embrasures
were cut through them for the guns, of which there
were four 9-pounders on that side.</p>

<p>A letter arrived from Cawnpore giving very bad
news. The enemy had shelled them for the last eight
days with fearful effect within their crowded trenches,
and one-third of their number had been killed. More
guns are brought in. They hear that eight or ten
regiments of rebels are within twenty miles of Lucknow.</p>

<p>On <i>June 28</i> Mrs. Dorin, wife of Lieutenant Dorin,
arrived at evening in a country cart, disguised as a native
and accompanied by some clerks. The enemy are nine
miles off. Though a force was sent out to meet them,
we had to retire before overwhelming numbers, with the
loss of the 8-inch howitzer and three 9-pounders.</p>

<p>The rebels came boldly on, investing the English on
all sides, and firing from all the houses round, which
they rapidly loopholed.</p>

<p><i>July 1.</i>&mdash;We managed to send message to blow up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
the Muchee Bhawun fort and come to the Residency
at 12 p.m., bringing the treasure and guns. We opened
fire from our batteries in order to distract the attention
of the enemy from them.</p>

<p>At 12.15 they were at the Lower Water Gate. Here
there was some delay, as the gates had not yet been
opened. A very serious accident had nearly happened,
for the leading men, finding the gate closed, shouted out,
“Open the gates!” but the artillerymen at the guns
above, which covered the entrance, mistook the words
for “Open with grape,” and were on the point to fire
when an officer ran up and put them right. The whole
force came in safely, not a shot being fired. The explosion
which had been ordered had not yet taken place,
but soon a tremor of the earth, a volume of fire, a terrific
report, and a mass of black smoke shooting up into the
air announced to Lucknow that 240 barrels of gunpowder
and 594,000 rounds of ball and gun ammunition
had completed the destruction of Muchee Bhawun, which
we had fortified with so much labour.</p>

<p>Strange stories were told by some of the refugees
from outlying districts. Here is one told by the wife
of a surgeon: “I heard a number of shots fired in our
station, and looking out, I saw my husband driving furiously
from the mess-house. I ran to him, and, catching
up my child, got into the buggy. At the mess-house
we found all the officers assembled, with sixty sepoys
who had remained faithful.</p>

<p>“As we went our homes were seen to be on fire. Next
morning our sepoy escort deserted us. We were fired on
by matchlock men and lost one officer. We had no food.
An officer kindly lent us a horse. We were very faint.
Our party now was only nine gentlemen, two children,
the sergeant, and his wife. On the 20th Captain Scott
took my little two-year-old Lottie on to his horse. Soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
after sunrise we were followed by villagers armed with
clubs and spears. One of them struck Captain Scott’s
horse on the leg. He galloped off with Lottie, and my
poor husband never saw his child again.</p>

<p>“We rode on several miles, keeping away from villages,
and then crossed the river. Our thirst was extreme.
Soon I saw water in a ravine. I climbed down the steep
descent. Our only drinking-vessel was M.’s cap (which
had once been a sepoy’s). Our horse got water and I
bathed my neck. I had no stockings and my feet were
torn and blistered. My husband was very weak, and,
I thought, dying. He wished me good-bye as he lay on
the ground. My brain seemed burnt up: no tears came.
Our horse cantered away, so that escape was cut off.
We sat down on the ground waiting for death. Poor
fellow! he was very weak; his thirst was frightful, and I
went to get him water. Some villagers came and took
my rupees and watch. I took off my wedding-ring,
twisted it in my hair and replaced the guard. I tore off
the skirt of my dress to bring water in; but it was no use,
for when I returned, my beloved’s eyes were fixed, and,
though I called and tried to restore him and poured water
into his mouth, it only rattled in his throat. He never
spoke to me again, and he gradually sank down and
died. I was alone. In an hour or so about thirty
villagers came. They dragged me out of the ravine and
took off my jacket; then they dragged me to a village,
mocking me all the way. The whole village came to
look at me. I lay down outside the door of a hut. They
had dozens of cows, and yet refused me milk. When
night came and the village was quiet, some old woman
brought me a leafful of rice. The next morning a
neighbouring Rajah sent a palanquin and a horseman to
fetch me, who told me that a little child and three sahibs
had come to his master’s house. That little child was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
my Lottie! She was sorely blistered, but, thank God!
alive and well.”</p>

<p>That is the sort of experience some ladies went through&mdash;ladies
that had never before known what thirst or privation
or insult was like.</p>

<p><i>July 2.</i>&mdash;About 8 a.m. Sir Henry returned to the
Residency and lay down on his bed. Soon after an
8-inch shell from the enemy’s howitzer entered the room
at the window and exploded. A fragment struck the
Brigadier-General on the upper part of the right thigh
near the hip, inflicting a fearful wound.</p>

<p>Captain Wilson, who was standing alongside the bed
with one knee on it, reading a memorandum to Sir Henry,
was knocked down by falling bricks. Mr. Lawrence,
Sir Henry’s nephew, had an equally narrow escape,
but was not hurt. The fourth person in the room, a
native servant, lost one of his feet by a fragment of the
shell. The ceiling and the punkah all came down, and
the dust and smoke prevented anyone seeing what had
happened.</p>

<p>Neither Sir Henry nor his nephew uttered a sound,
and Captain Wilson, as soon as he recovered from the
concussion, called out in alarm: “Sir Henry, are you
hurt?”</p>

<p>Twice he thus called out and got no reply. After
the third time Sir Henry said in a low tone: “I am
killed.”</p>

<p>His bed was being soaked with blood. Some soldiers
of the 32nd soon came in and placed Sir Henry in a chair.
When the surgeon came he saw that human aid was
useless. Lucknow and England had lost what could
never be replaced. For all who ever came in contact
with Sir Henry Lawrence recognized in him a man of
unstained honour, a lover of justice, pure, unselfish and
noble. His successor, Brigadier Inglis, wrote of him:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
“Few men have ever possessed to the same extent the
power which he enjoyed of winning the hearts of all those
with whom he came in contact.” He gained also by his
frankness the trust of the natives, who said of him:
“When Sir Henry looks twice up to heaven and once
down to earth, and then strokes his beard, he knows
what to do.” His dying wish was that, if any epitaph
were placed on his tomb, it should be this: “Here lies
Henry Lawrence, who tried to do his duty.” He had
indeed tried to do his duty towards the defence of
Lucknow. Three weeks before anyone else thought of a
siege he began to collect supplies, and even paid for them
much over their market value. He collected and buried
much treasure in the grounds of the Residency; he
stored up in underground cellars guns and mortars,
shot and shell and grain; strengthened the outworks,
and cleared the ground of small buildings around. Even
then the assailants and the besieged were quite close
to each other, and no man on either side dared expose
himself to fire his musket: they fired through loopholes
in the walls. This placed a never-ending strain on the
besieged, for they never knew when to expect an assault.
On the one side of a narrow lane were myriads of swarthy
foemen, on the other side a few hundreds, who were
bound always to be ready, day and night, to meet a storming
party. All through the siege officers and men alike
stood sentry; all bore an equal burden of toil and fighting.</p>

<p>The stench, too, from dead animals was dreadful:
they had so few servants, and the fighting men were so
harassed, that they were helpless to bury them.</p>

<p>Heavy showers night and day kept the garrison
drenched to the skin, and they had no change of clothes.
The sick and wounded were much crowded, as they could
not use the upper story of the hospital because it was
under fire of round shot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p><i>August 12.</i>&mdash;A letter to General Havelock, rolled up
and put inside a quill, was despatched by the hands of
an old woman. She left the position about 9 p.m.,
and it was hoped she would be permitted to pass the
enemy’s sentries. During the past forty-five days they
had sent by different hands, in a similar manner, some
twenty letters. To only one of these was any reply
received.</p>

<p><i>August 18.</i>&mdash;At daylight the enemy exploded a large
mine under one of the principal posts. The three officers
and three sentries on the top of the house were blown up
into the air; the guard below were all buried in the ruins.
The officers, though much stunned, recovered and escaped.
A clear breach had been made in our defences to the
extent of 30 feet in breadth. One of the enemy’s leaders
sprung on the top of the breach and called on his comrades
to follow; but when he and another had been shot
the rest hung back. Boxes, doors, planks, etc., were
rapidly carried down to make cover to protect the men.</p>

<p><i>August 23.</i>&mdash;There was work nightly for at least 300
men, as they had the defences to repair daily, mines
to countermine, guns to remove, corpses to bury, rations
to serve out. The Europeans were not capable of much
exertion, as from want of sleep, hard work, and
constant exposure, their bodily strength was greatly
diminished. The ladies had to be removed, as the upper
story of Mr. Gubbins’ house was no longer safe, owing
to the number of round shot through it. It was difficult
to find quarters for them, every place being so crowded,
and the ladies were already four and five together in small,
badly ventilated native dwellings. Dreadful smells pervaded
the whole place, from the half-buried bodies of
men, horses, and bullocks, and also from the drains.</p>

<p><i>September 9.</i>&mdash;During the night a shell exploded in a
room occupied by a lady and some children, and, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
almost every article in the room was destroyed, they all
escaped unhurt. Finding that the enemy were rapidly
mining towards the Cawnpore battery, they sprung a
mine containing 200 pounds of powder. The effect was
tremendous, and it evidently astonished the enemy to
see their miners going up skywards in fragments.</p>

<p>As the uniforms wore out they clothed themselves as
they could. One officer had a coat made out of an old
billiard cloth; another wore a shirt made out of a floor-cloth.
They had no tobacco, and had to smoke dried tea-leaves.</p>

<p>“<i>September 14.</i>&mdash;A grievous loss to-day: Captain Fulton,
of the Engineers, while reconnoitring from a battery, was
killed by a round shot which struck him on the head.
He had conducted all the engineering operations of the
siege for a long time. He was a highly gifted, brave and
chivalrous officer, and a great favourite.”</p>

<p><i>September 22.</i>&mdash;About 11 p.m. Ungud, pensioner, returned
to Lucknow, bringing a letter containing the glad
tidings that the relieving force, under General Outram,
had crossed the Ganges, and would arrive in a few days.</p>

<p>His arrival and the cheering news he brought of speedy
aid was well timed, for daily desertions of servants were
becoming the rule. All the garrison were greatly elated
at the news, and on many of the sick and wounded the
speedy prospect of a change of air and security exercised
a most beneficial effect.</p>

<p><i>September 25.</i>&mdash;About 11 a.m. increasing agitation was
visible among the people in the town. An hour later they
heard guns and saw the smoke. All the garrison was on
the alert; the excitement amongst many of the officers
and men was quite painful to witness. At 1.30 p.m.
many were leaving the city with bundles of clothes on
their heads. The rebels’ bridge of boats had evidently
been destroyed, for they could see many swimming across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
the river, most of them cavalry, with their horses’ bridles
in their hands. During all this apparent panic the guns
of the enemy in position all round were keeping up a
heavy cannonade, and the riflemen never ceased firing
from their loopholes.</p>

<p>At 4 p.m. report was made that some officers dressed
in shooting-coats and caps, a regiment of Europeans in
blue pantaloons and shirts, could be seen near Mr. Martin’s
house. At 5 p.m. volleys of musketry, rapidly growing
louder, were heard in the city. But soon the firing of a
minie-ball over their heads gave notice of the still nearer
approach of their friends. It was very exciting, but
they as yet could see little of them, though they could
hear the rebels firing on them from the roofs of the houses.</p>

<p>Will they again be repulsed? The heart sickens at
the thought. No. Five minutes later, and our troops
are seen fighting their way through one of the principal
streets, and though men are falling at almost every step,
yet on they come. Nothing can withstand the headlong
gallantry of our reinforcements. Once fairly seen and
all doubts and fears are ended. And now the garrison’s
long pent-up feelings of anxiety and suspense burst
forth in a succession of deafening cheers. From every
pit, trench and battery, from behind the sand-bags piled
up on shattered houses, from every post still held by a
few gallant spirits, rose cheer on cheer&mdash;aye, even from
the hospital.</p>

<p>Many of the wounded were crawling forth to join in
that glad shout of welcome to those who had so bravely
come to their assistance. The ladies were in tears&mdash;tears
of joy; some were on their knees, already thanking God
for a deliverance from unspeakable horrors. It was a
moment never to be forgotten. Soon all the rearguard
and heavy guns were inside our position, and then ensued
a scene which baffles description. For eighty-seven days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
the Lucknow garrison had lived in utter ignorance of all
that had taken place outside. Wives who had mourned
their husbands as dead were again restored to them;
others, fondly looking forward to glad meetings with
those near and dear to them, now for the first time
learnt that they were alone in the world. On all sides
eager inquiries were made for relations and friends.
Oh, what a hubbub of voices, what exclamations of delight,
what sad silences!</p>

<p>The force under the command of Sir James Outram
and Havelock had suffered heavily. Out of 2,600 who
had left Cawnpore nearly one-third had been either killed
or wounded in forcing their way through the city.
Indeed, their losses were so heavy that they could effect
little towards the relief, for the rebels were in overpowering
force, so that the garrison remained on three-quarter
rations, as closely besieged as before, looking for a day
when they might be more effectually relieved by a larger
and stronger force.</p>

<p>Then, after the personal inquiries had died down, with
bated breath they asked for news of Cawnpore. What
a tale of horror, of pride, of shame! On the 5th of June,
so they were told, the Cawnpore regiments mutinied and
set off for Delhi. On the 6th they were brought back
by Nana Sahib, a man who had once been well received
in London drawing-rooms, now the arch-traitor and
murderer.</p>

<p>Not less than 1,000 persons took refuge in the Residency,
which Nana proceeded to invest. It was a poor,
weak place to defend, yet they kept the flag flying till
the 24th of June, when their ammunition and provisions
were all gone. Time after time the gallant little garrison
repulsed all the Nana’s attacks. At length he approached
them with treacherous smiles, and offered to transmit
them safely to Allahabad on conditions of surrender.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
General Sir Hugh Wheeler undertook to deliver up the
fortifications, the treasure, and the artillery on condition
that our force should march out under arms, with sixty
rounds of ammunition to every man; that carriages
should be provided for the conveyance of the wounded,
the women, and the children; that boats provided with
flour should be in readiness at the landing-place.</p>

<p>What happened was described by one who had been on
the spot. He said:</p>

<p>“The whole of Cawnpore was astir at an early hour to
see the English depart. They poured down to the
landing-place in thousands. Meanwhile a crowd of
carriages and beasts of burden had been collected outside
the entrenchments. The bullock-carts were soon
filled with women and children. A fine elephant had
been sent for the General, but he put his wife and
daughters in the state howdah, and contented himself
with a simple palanquin. The wounded were placed in
litters with such care as soldiers could employ. Many
sepoys mingling with the crowd expressed admiration
for the British defence; some even wept over the sufferings
of their late masters. Eleven dying Europeans were
left behind, too ill to be moved.</p>

<p>“They set off, with the men of the 32nd Regiment at
their head; then came a throng of naked bearers,
carrying the palanquins full of sick and wounded; then
came the bullock-carts crowded with ladies and children;
and next, musket on shoulder, came all who could still
walk and fight. Major Vibart of the Second Cavalry
came last. Colonel and Mrs. Ewart started late, she on
foot, walking beside her husband, who was borne by four
native porters. As they dropped astern some natives
belonging to the Colonel’s own battalion approached him.
They began to mock him, and then cut him in pieces with
their swords. They did the same to his wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>“The road to the landing-place, which is about a mile
from the entrenchments, runs down a ravine, which in
summer is dry, and is enclosed on either side by high
banks and crumbling fences. As the van turned down
this ravine a great mob of natives watched them go in a
strange silence.</p>

<p>“Rather disorderly, with swaying howdahs and grunting
beasts, the unwieldy caravan wound along the sandy
lane. When they were all entangled in the little defile
some sepoys quietly formed a double line across the
mouth of the gorge, shutting, as it were, the top of the
trap.</p>

<p>“Meanwhile the head of the caravan had reached the
landing-place, being a little surprised at the want of a
pier or planks to serve as gangway.</p>

<p>“But the English officers went in knee-deep and
hoisted the wounded and the women into the covered
barges, which had been hauled into the shallows, and were
in many cases grounded on the sandy bottom. The
boats were 30 feet from stem to stern and 12 feet in beam,
roofed with straw, having a space at each end for the
rowers and the steersman. They looked very old and
dilapidated, but beggars may not choose. Hindoo boatmen
were waiting sullenly and silently, not deigning to
return a smile to the little English children, who already
began to scent fun and enjoyment in a long river excursion.</p>

<p>“All at once a bugle rang out from the top of the
defile. Away splashed the native rowers, jumping from
their boats into the water.</p>

<p>“The rebels put up their muskets and fired point-blank
into the laden boats; but the English had their
rifles, and returned the fire.</p>

<p>“Yet another surprise! Suddenly the straw roofs of
the native boats burst into flame, and from either shore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
of the river grape and musket shot were poured in relentlessly.
The wounded lay still and were burnt to
death. Ladies and children sought the protection of the
water, and crouched in the shallows under the sterns of
the barges. The men tried to push off, but the keels
stuck fast. Out of two dozen boats only three drifted
slowly down from the stage. Of these three two went
across to the Oude bank, where stood two cannon,
guarded by a battalion of infantry and some cavalry.
The third boat, containing Vibart and Whiting and Ushe,
Delafosse and Bolton, Burney and Glanville and Moore,
the bravest of the brave, got clear away, and drifted
down the main channel.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bradshaw thus describes what she saw: “In
the boat where I was to have gone were the school-mistress
and twenty-two missies. General Wheeler came
last in a palkee. They carried him into the water near
a boat. I was standing close by. He said, ‘Carry me
a little further near the boat.’ But a trooper said, ‘No;
get out here.’ As the General got out of the palkee,
head foremost, the trooper gave him a cut with his sword
into the neck, and he fell into the water. My son was
killed near him. I saw it&mdash;alas! alas! Some were
stabbed with bayonets; others were cut down with
swords and knives. Little infants were torn in pieces.
We saw it, we did, and tell you only what we saw. Other
children were stabbed and thrown into the river. The
school-girls were burnt to death. I saw their clothes and
hair catch fire. In the water, a few paces off, by the
next boat, we saw the youngest daughter of Colonel
Williams. A sepoy was going to kill her with his bayonet,
when she said, ‘My father was always kind to sepoys.’
He turned away, and just then a villager struck her on
the head with his club, and she fell into the water.”</p>

<p>After a time the women and children who had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
been shot, stabbed, or burnt were collected and brought
to shore, some of them being rudely handled by the
sowars, who tore from ear or finger such jewels as caught
their fancy.</p>

<p>About 120 sat or lay on the shore or on logs of timber,
full of misery, fear, and despair. There they waited in
the blinding sun on the Ganges shore all that morning.
Then they were herded back along the narrow lane by
which they had come with hope in their bosoms, while
the sepoys who guarded them grinned with fiendish
delight, and showed gleefully all their spoils. Past the
bazaar and the chapel and the racquet-court and the
entrenchments they limped along, until they were paraded
before the pavilion of the Maharajah, who looked
them well over, and ordered them to be confined in the
Savada House. Two good-sized rooms, which had been
used by native soldiers for a month, were given them to
live in, and a guard was placed over them.</p>

<p>One witness says: “I saw that many of the ladies were
wounded. Their clothes had blood on them. Some
were wet, covered with mud and blood, and some had
their dresses badly torn, but all had clothes. I saw one
or two children without clothes. There were no men in
the party, but only some boys of twelve or thirteen years
of age. Some of the ladies were barefoot and lame.
Two I saw were wounded in the leg.”</p>

<p>And what of the third boat which floated down-stream?</p>

<p>More than 100 persons had taken refuge in it. Some
officers and men, seeing how hopeless was the fight
on the bank, had swum out to Vibart and his crew.
Now they stranded on a mud-bank, now they drifted
towards the guns on the other shore, ever under a hot
fire of canister and shell, and continually losing brave
men who were shot at point-blank range. Down in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
bottom of the great barge lay dying and dead, till at
last the survivors were compelled to throw the bodies
overboard.</p>

<p>At night a fire-ship was sent down to set them alight,
and fire-tipped arrows were shot into the thatched roof,
forcing our people to cut them away. Then they came
under a fierce fire from the militia of Ram Bux. Pelting
rains came down, and they drifted up a backwater, and
soon after a host of rebels surrounded the poor, stricken
fugitives and took them back to Cawnpore.</p>

<p>The doomed boat-load were seen to be drawing near
the landing-place early on the morning of the 30th. This
is what a native spy said of them:</p>

<p>“There were brought back sixty sahibs, twenty-five
mem sahibs, and four children. The Nana ordered the
sahibs to be separated from the mem sahibs, and shot
by the 1st Bengal Native Infantry. But they said, ‘We
will not kill the sahibs; put them in prison.’ Then said
the Nadiree Regiment: ‘What word is this&mdash;put them
in prison? We will kill the males ourselves.’</p>

<p>“So the sahibs were seated on the ground. Two companies
stood with their muskets, ready to fire. Then
said one of the mem sahibs, the doctor’s wife: ‘I
will not leave my husband. If he must die, I will die
with him.’ So she ran and sat down behind her husband,
clasping him round the waist.</p>

<p>“When she said this the other mem sahibs said: ‘We
also will die with our husbands;’ and they all sat down,
each by her husband.</p>

<p>“Then their husbands said: ‘Go back;’ but they
would not do so.</p>

<p>“So then the Nana gave order, and his soldiers went in
and pulled them away by force. But they could not pull
away the doctor’s wife, who stayed there. Then the
padre asked leave to read prayers before they died. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
did so, and then shut the book. Then all the sahibs
shook hands and bid good-bye. Then the sepoys fired.
One sahib rolled one way, one another, but they were
not quite dead; so the sepoys went at them and finished
them off with their swords.”</p>

<p>Can you imagine the breathless horror with which the
garrison of Lucknow listened to these details of a most
cruel and treacherous onslaught upon wounded men,
upon refined ladies, and innocent children? How they
sighed for a force strong enough to take an adequate
revenge upon these miscreants! But for the present
they were besieged themselves, though reinforced; and
who of them could count upon a day’s security? Perhaps,
if the bullet spared them at Lucknow their would-be
rescuers might be unable to fight their way through the
city, and these poor ladies and children of the Lucknow
garrison might be reserved for a lot even worse than
death. “Will they come?&mdash;will they come to help us
here at Lucknow? That is our anxious thought night
and day.”</p>

Residency&mdash;A quick march back&mdash;Who stole the biscuits?&mdash;Sir
Colin’s own regiment.</p>

<p>“I had enlisted in the 93rd Sutherland Highlanders to
go to India to put down the Mutiny,” writes Mr. Forbes-Mitchell,
an old friend of the author. “We reached
Cawnpore on the 27th of October, having marched the
last forty-six miles in two days. We were over 1,000
strong, and many of us had just been through the
Crimean War. After a few hours’ rest we were allowed
to go out in parties of ten or twelve to visit the scene of
the late treachery and massacre.”</p>

<p>Wheeler’s entrenchments at the highest place did not
exceed 4 feet, and could not have been bullet-proof at
the top. The wonder was how the small force could
have held out so long. In the rooms were still lying
about broken toys, pictures, books, and bits of clothing.
They then went to see the slaughter-house in which our
women and children had been barbarously murdered
and the well into which their mangled bodies were flung.
On the date of this visit a great part of the house had
not been cleaned out. The floors of the rooms were
still covered with congealed blood, and littered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
trampled, torn dresses, shoes, locks of long hair, many
of which evidently had been severed by sword-cuts. But
the most horrible sight they saw was an iron hook fixed
into the wall. This was covered with dried blood, and
from the marks on the whitewashed wall it was evident
that a little child had been hung on to it by the neck,
with its face to the wall. There the poor thing must have
struggled for long, because the wall all round the hook
was covered with the hand-prints, and below the hook
with the footprints, of a little child&mdash;in blood.</p>

<p>The number of victims killed at Cawnpore, counted
and buried in the well by Havelock’s force, was 118
women and 92 children. This sight was enough, they
said, to make the words “mercy” and “pardon” appear
a mockery.</p>

<p>The troops crossed into Oude on the 2nd of November,
and on the 3rd a salute fired from the mud fort on the
Cawnpore side told them that, to their great delight, Sir
Colin Campbell had come up from Calcutta. They were
all burning to start for Lucknow. Every man in the
regiment was determined to risk his life to save the
women and children from the fate of Cawnpore.</p>

<p>On their march they saw they were at once in an
enemy’s country. None of the villages were inhabited.
There was no chance of buying chupatties (girdle-cakes)
or goat’s milk. It was the custom to serve out three
days’ biscuits at one time, running four to the pound.
Most men usually had finished their biscuits before they
reached the first halting-ground.</p>

<p>Before they made their first halt they could hear the
guns of the rebels bombarding the Residency. Footsore
and tired as they were, the report of each salvo
made the men step out with a firmer tread and a more
determined resolve to relieve those helpless women and
children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 10th of November they were encamped on the
plain about five miles in front of the Alumbâgh, about
5,000 of them, the only really complete regiment being
the 93rd Highlanders, of whom some 700 wore the
Crimean medal. They were in full Highland costume,
feather bonnets and dark waving plumes&mdash;a solid mass
of brawny-limbed men.</p>

<p>The old chief rode along the line, saying a few words
to each corps as he passed. The regiment remarked that
none of the other corps had given him a single cheer, but
had taken what he said in solemn silence. At last he
came to the 93rd, who were formed close column, so that
every man might hear. When Sir Colin rode up he
seemed to have a worn and haggard expression on his
face, but he was received with such a cheer, or rather
shout of welcome, as made the echoes ring. His wrinkled
brow at once became smooth, and his weary features
broke into a smile as he acknowledged the cheer by a
hearty salute. He ended his speech thus: “Ninety-third,
you are my own lads. I rely on you to do the
work.” A voice from the ranks called out: “Ay, ay, Sir
Colin! ye ken us, and we ken you. We’ll bring the women
and children out of Lucknow or die in the attempt;” and
the whole regiment burst into another ringing cheer.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 14th of November they began
the advance on the Dilkoosha Park and Palace. The
Fourth Brigade, composed of the 53rd, 93rd, and 4th
Punjab Regiments, with a strong force of artillery,
reached the walls at sunrise. Here they halted till a
breach was made in the walls. The park swarmed with
deer&mdash;black buck and spotted. There were no signs of
the enemy, and a staff-officer of the artillery galloped to
the front to reconnoitre. This was none other than the
present Lord Roberts, known to the men then as “Plucky
Wee Bobs.” About half of the regiment had passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
through the breach, when a masked battery of six guns
opened fire on them from behind the palace. The first
shot passed through the column, the second cut in two
a trooper’s horse close to Roberts, who dismounted and
helped the trooper to his feet. They all cheered the
young Lieutenant for his coolness under a point-blank
fire of 9-pounders. They kept on pegging away until
the sepoys bolted down the hill for shelter in the Martinière.
About two o’clock they drove the rebels out,
occupied the Martinière and erected a semaphore on the
roof to communicate with the Residency.</p>

<p>They next fought their way to a village on the east
side of the Secundrabâgh. Here they saw a naked
wretch with shaven head and body painted and smeared
with ashes. He was sitting on a leopard-skin, counting
a rosary of beads. James Wilson said:</p>

<p>“I’d like to try my bayonet on that fellow’s hide;”
but Captain Mayne replied:</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t touch him. These fellows are harmless
Hindoo <i>jogees</i>” (mendicants).</p>

<p>The words had scarcely been uttered when the painted
scoundrel stopped counting his beads, slipped his hand
under his leopard-skin, brought out a short brass blunderbuss,
and fired it into Captain Mayne’s chest, a few feet off.
The fellow was instantly bayoneted, but poor Mayne died.</p>

<p>From the Secundrabâgh came a murderous fire, and
they had to wait for the guns to make a breach.</p>

<p>“Lie down, 93rd, lie down!” shouted Sir Colin. “Every
man of you is worth his weight in gold to England to-day.”</p>

<p>When the breach was large enough the 4th Punjabis
led the assault, but seeing their officers shot down, they
wavered. Sir Colin turned to Colonel Ewart and said:</p>

<p>“Bring on the tartan. Let my own lads at them.”</p>

<p>Before the buglers had time to sound the advance the
whole seven companies, like one man, leaped the wall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
with such a yell of pent-up rage as never was heard before
nor since. The bayonet did the work effectually. Many
of the Highlanders were wounded in the leg because the
native tulwârs were as sharp as razors, and when the
rebels had fired their muskets they hurled them like
javelins, bayonets first, and then drawing their tulwârs,
slashed in blind fury, shouting, “Deen! Deen!” (“The
faith!”), and some threw themselves down and slashed
at the legs of the Highlanders.</p>

<p>In the centre of the inner court of the Secundrabâgh
there was a large peepul-tree (Indian fig), with a very
bushy top, and round the foot of it were set some jars
full of cool water. Captain Dawson noticed that many
of our men lay dead under this tree, and he called out
to Wallace, a good shot, to look up and try if he could see
anyone in the top, as the dead seemed to be shot from
above.</p>

<p>Wallace stepped back and scanned the tree. “I see
him, sir,” he shouted, and cocking his rifle, he fired.
Down fell a body dressed in a tight-fitting red jacket and
rose-coloured silk trousers. The breast of the jacket bursting
open with the fall showed that the wearer was a woman.</p>

<p>She was armed with a pair of heavy old-pattern cavalry
pistols. From her perch in the tree, which had been
carefully prepared before the attack, she had killed more
than half a dozen men. Poor Wallace burst into tears,
saying: “If I had known it was a woman I would never
have harmed her.”</p>

<p>When the roll was called it was found that we had lost
nine officers and ninety-nine men. Sir Colin rode up and
said: “Fifty-third and Ninety-third, you have bravely
done your share of this morning’s work, and Cawnpore is
avenged.”</p>

<p>“On revisiting Lucknow many years after this I saw
no tablet or grave to mark the spot where so many of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
93rd are buried. It is the old, old story which was said
to have been first written on the walls of Badajos:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">“When war is rife and danger nigh,</div>
<div class="i0">God and the soldier is all the cry;</div>
<div class="i0">When war is over and wrongs are righted,</div>
<div class="i0">God is forgot and the soldier slighted.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>“After the Secundrabâgh we had to advance on the
Shâh Nujeef. As the 24-pounders were being dragged
along by our men and Peel’s sailors a poor sailor lad just
in front had his leg carried clean off above the knee by
a round shot, and although knocked head over heels by
the force of the ball, he sat bolt upright on the grass,
with the blood spouting from the stump of his limb like
water from the hose of a fire-engine, and shouted:</p>

<p>“‘Here goes a shilling a day&mdash;a shilling a day! Pitch
into them, boys! Remember Cawnpore, 93rd&mdash;remember
Cawnpore! Go at them, my hearties!’ and
then he fell back in a dead faint. He was dead before a
doctor could reach him.”</p>

<p>Sir Colin himself was wounded by a bullet after it had
passed through the head of a 93rd Grenadier.</p>

<p>Amongst the force defending the Shâh Nujeef there was
a large body of archers on the walls armed with bows
and arrows, which they discharged with great force and
precision, and on Sergeant White raising his head above
the wall an arrow was shot right into his feather bonnet.
Inside the wire cage of his bonnet he had placed his
forage-cap, folded up, and instead of passing right
through, the arrow stuck in the folds of his cap. White,
drawing out the arrow, cried: “My conscience! Bows
and arrows! Have we got Robin Hood and Little John
back again? Well, well, Jack Pandy, since bows and
arrows are the word, here’s at you!” and with that he
raised his bonnet on the point of his bayonet above the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
top of the wall, and at once another arrow pierced it
through, while a dozen more whizzed past a little wide of
the mark.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">

<p class="header">The Lighter Side of War at Lucknow</p>

<p>A body of archers were amongst the defenders of the Shâh Nujeef. A Highland
sergeant put his bonnet on his bayonet and held it up, and it was at once pierced by
an arrow.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Just then Penny, of No. 2 Company, looking over the
wall, got an arrow right through his brain, the shaft projecting
more than a foot at the back of his head.</p>

<p>Then they all loaded and capped, and, pushing up their
bonnets again, a whole shower of arrows went past or
through them. Up they sprang and returned a well-aimed
volley from their rifles at point-blank distance,
and more than half a dozen of the rebels went down.
But Montgomery exposed himself a little too long to
watch the effects of the volley, and before he could get
down into shelter an arrow was sent through his heart,
passing clean through his body, and falling on the ground
a few yards behind him. He leaped about 6 feet
straight up in the air and fell stone dead.</p>

<p>But as yet we had made little impression on the solid
masonry walls, and one of our ammunition waggons
exploded, killing several men, and our storming party
was repulsed. Just then Sergeant Paton came running
up out of breath to say he had found a wide breach on
the other side. It seems our shot and shell had gone over
the first wall and had blown out the wall on the other
side. Paton had climbed up easily and seen right inside
the place. So Captain Dawson and his company were
sent with Paton, and when the enemy saw them come
in behind them they fled like sheep.</p>

<p>Thus ended the terrible 16th of November, 1857.</p>

<p>“An adventure happened to me in the Shâh Nujeef,”
says Forbes-Mitchell, “which I still sometimes dream
of with horror. This place was the tomb of the first
King of Oude, and a place of Mohammedan pilgrimage.
It had a number of small rooms round the enclosure for
the pilgrims. These the enemy had used for quarters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
and in their hurry to escape many had left their lamps
burning. As I had lost my greatcoat in the fight, and
felt very cold at night, so that I could not sleep, it struck
me that some of the sepoys might have left blankets
behind them. With this hope I went into one of the
rooms where a lamp was burning, took it off its shelf, and
walked to the door of the great domed tomb, which was
only 20 yards or so away from the spot where the arms
were piled and the men lying round the still burning fire.
I peered into the dark vault, but could see nothing, so
I advanced slowly, holding above my head the clay
saucer of oil containing a loose cotton wick. I was
looking cautiously round, for fear of surprise from a concealed
foe, till I came near the centre of the great vault,
where my progress was obstructed by a big black heap
about 4 feet high, which felt to my feet as if I were
walking in loose sand. I lowered the lamp to see what
it was, and discovered that I was standing up to the
ankles in loose gunpowder!</p>

<p>“About 40 hundredweight of it lay in a great heap in
front of my nose, while a glance to my left showed me a
range of some thirty barrels also full of powder, and on
the right lots of 8-inch shells, all loaded, with the fuses
fixed.</p>

<p>“By this time my eyes had become accustomed to
the darkness of the mosque, and I took in my position at
a glance. Here I was up to my knees almost in powder&mdash;in
the very bowels of a magazine&mdash;with a naked light!</p>

<p>“My hair literally stood on end. I felt the skin of my
head lifting my feather bonnet off my scalp. My knees
knocked together, and, despite the chilly night air, the
cold perspiration burst out all over me and ran down my
face and legs.</p>

<p>“I had neither cloth nor handkerchief in my pocket,
and there was not a moment to be lost, as already the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
overhanging wick was threatening to shed its smouldering
red tip into the live magazine at my feet.</p>

<p>“Quick as thought I put my left hand under the down-dropping
flame and clasped it firmly. Holding it so, I
slowly turned to the door and walked out with my knees
knocking one against the other. I never felt the least
pain from the wick, fear had so overcome me; but when
I opened my hand on gaining the open air, I felt the
smart acutely enough. I poured the oil out of the saucer
into the burnt hand, then kneeling down, I thanked God
for having saved me and all our men around from horrible
destruction. I then got up and staggered rather than
walked to the place where Captain Dawson was sleeping.
I shook him by the shoulder till he awoke, and told him
of my discovery and fright.</p>

<p>“‘Bah, Corporal Mitchell!’ was all his answer. ‘You
have woke up out of your sleep and have got frightened
at a shadow’&mdash;for he saw me all trembling.</p>

<p>“I turned my smarting hand to the light of the fire
and showed the Captain how it was scorched; and then,
feeling my pride hurt, I said: ‘Sir, you’re not a Highlander,
or you would know the Gaelic proverb, “The
heart of one who can look death in the face will not start
at a shadow,” and you, sir, can bear witness that I have
not shirked to look death in the face more than once since
morning.’</p>

<p>“He replied: ‘Pardon me. I did not mean that. But
calm yourself and explain.’</p>

<p>“I then told him that I had gone into the mosque with
a naked lamp, and had found it half full of loose gunpowder.</p>

<p>“‘Are you sure you’re not dreaming from the excitement
of this awful day?’ he asked.</p>

<p>“With that I looked down to my feet and my gaiters,
which were still covered with blood from the slaughter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
in the Secundrabâgh. The wet grass had softened it again,
and on this the powder was sticking nearly an inch thick.
I scraped some of it off, throwing it into the fire, and said:</p>

<p>“‘There is positive proof for you that I’m not dreaming,
nor my vision a shadow.’</p>

<p>“On that the Captain became almost as alarmed as I
was, and a sentry was posted near the door of the mosque
to prevent anyone entering it.</p>

<p>“The sleeping men were aroused, and the fire smothered
out by jars of water. Then Captain Dawson and I, with
an escort of four men, went round the rooms. As Wilson,
one of the escort, was peering into a room, a concealed
sepoy struck him over the head with his tulwâr; but his
bonnet saved him, and Captain Dawson put a pistol
bullet through the sepoy to save further trouble.</p>

<p>“After all was quiet the men rolled off to sleep again,
and I too lay down and tried to sleep. My nerves were,
however, too much shaken, and the burnt hand kept me
awake, so I lay and listened to the men sleeping round
me. And what a night that was! The horrible scenes
through which the men had passed during the day had told
with terrible effect upon their nerves, and the struggles
with death in the Secundrabâgh were fought over again
by some of the men in their sleep, oaths and shouts of
defiance being often strangely intermingled with prayers.</p>

<p>“One man would be lying calmly asleep and then suddenly
break out into a fierce battle-cry of ‘Cawnpore!
you bloody murderer!’ Another would shout, ‘Charge!
give them the bayonet!’ and a third, ‘Keep together,
boys; don’t fire yet. Forward! forward! If we are to
die, let us die like men!’</p>

<p>“Then I would hear one muttering, ‘Oh, mother, forgive
me, and I’ll never leave you again.’ So it was
through all that memorable night, and I have no doubt
it was the same at the other posts. At last I dozed off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
and dreamed of blood and battle, and anon of Dee or
Don side and the Braemar gathering; then the scene
would change, and I was a little boy again, kneeling
beside my mother, saying my evening hymn. Verily
Campbell’s ‘Soldier’s Dream’ is no fiction.”</p>

<p>Next morning they found plenty of pumpkins and piles
of flat cakes already cooked, but no salt; but Mitchell
had an old matchbox full of salt in his haversack. An
old veteran who used to tell stories of Waterloo had said
to him at home: “Always carry a box of salt in your
haversack when on active service: it will be useful.” So
it was very often. After breakfast they sponged out
their rifles, which had become so foul that the men’s
shoulders were black with bruises from the recoil.</p>

<p>They had to assault the mess-house next, and after
they had driven the rebels into the River Goomtee they
peppered every head that showed above water.</p>

<p>One tall fellow acted as cunningly as a jackal. Whether
struck or not, he fell just as he got into shallow water on
the opposite side, and lay without moving, with his legs
in the water and his head on the land. He appeared to
be stone dead, and every rifle was turned on those that
were running across the plain, while many that were
wounded were fired on, as the fellows said, in mercy to
put them out of pain. For this war of the Mutiny was a
demoralizing war for civilized men to be engaged in.
The cold-blooded cruelty of the rebels branded them as
traitors to humanity and cowardly assassins of helpless
women and children.</p>

<p>But to return to our Pandy. He was ever after spoken
of as “the Jackal,” because jackals often behave as he
did. After he had lain apparently dead for about an
hour, some one noticed that he had gradually dragged
himself out of the water. Then all at once he sprang to
his feet and ran like a deer. He was still within easy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
range, and several rifles were levelled at him; but Sergeant
Findlay, who was on the rampart, called out: “Don’t
fire, men; give the poor devil a chance.” So instead of
a volley of bullets the men’s better feelings gained the
day, and Jack Pandy was reprieved, with a cheer to speed
him on his way. As soon as he heard it he realized his
position, and like the Samaritan leper of old, he halted,
turned round, and putting up both his hands with the
palms together in front of his face, he salaamed profoundly,
prostrating himself three times on the ground by way of
thanks, while the men on the ramparts waved their
bonnets and clapped their hands to him in token of goodwill.</p>

<p>Just at this time was heard a great sound of cheering
near the Residency, the cause of which they shortly
learned. It was because General Sir Colin Campbell had
met Havelock and Outram. So then they knew the
Residency was relieved, and the women and children were
saved, though not yet out of danger. Every man in the
force slept with a lighter heart that night.</p>

<p>A girl in the Residency&mdash;Jessie Brown&mdash;had stated
that she heard the skirl of the bagpipes hours before the
relieving force could be seen or heard by the rest of the
garrison, “and I believe it was quite true. I know we
heard their bagpipes a long way off. Well, we had relieved
Lucknow, but at what a cost! No less than
forty-five officers and 496 men had been killed&mdash;more
than a tenth of our whole number.”</p>

<p>The Residency was relieved on the afternoon of the
17th of November, and the following day preparations
were made for the evacuation of the position and the
withdrawal of the women and children. To do this in
safety, however, was no easy task, for the rebels showed
but small regard for the laws of chivalry. There was a
long stretch of plain, exposed to the fire of the enemy’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
artillery and sharp-shooters from the opposite side of the
Goomtee. To protect this part of the route all the best
shots were placed on the north-west corner of the ramparts
next to the Goomtee. They were under the command
of Sergeant Findlay. One very good shot that
excellent marksman made. A rebel officer rode out with
a force of infantry from the east gate of the Bâdshâh-hibâgh.
They had a couple of guns, too, to open fire on
the line of retreat. They might have played havoc with
the retiring garrison, but Findlay managed to unhorse
the officer at long distance, and as soon as he was knocked
over the enemy retreated into the bâgh, and did not show
themselves any more that day.</p>

<p>By midnight of the 22nd of November the Residency
was entirely evacuated, and the enemy completely
deceived as to the movements. The women and children
had passed the exposed part of their route without
a single casualty.</p>

<p>The roll was called on reaching the Martinière, and two
were found to be missing. They had been left asleep in
the barracks, and came in later, saying that the rebels
had not yet discovered that the English had gone and were
still firing into the Residency. Shortly after the roll-call
a most unfortunate accident took place. Corporal
Cooper and four or five men went into one of the rooms
of the Martinière in which there was a quantity of loose
powder which had been left by the enemy, and somehow
the powder got ignited and they were all blown up, their
bodies completely charred and their eyes scorched out.
The poor fellows all died in the greatest agony within
an hour or so of the accident, and none of them could tell
how it happened.</p>

<p>“This sad accident made me very mindful of and
thankful for my own narrow escape and that of my comrades
in the Shâh Nujeef.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>“An amusing thing occurred on the march to Cawnpore.
As all the subaltern officers in my company were
wounded I was told off, with a guard of twenty men, to
see all the baggage-carts across Bunnee Bridge. A commissariat
cart, loaded with biscuits, got upset, and its
wheel broke just as we were moving it on to the road.</p>

<p>“The only person in charge of the cart was a young
bâboo, a boy of eighteen years of age, who defended his
charge as long as he could; but he was soon put on one
side, the biscuit bags were ripped open, and the men
commenced filling their haversacks.</p>

<p>“Just at this moment an escort of the 9th Lancers,
with some staff-officers, rode up from the rear. It was
the Commander-in-Chief and his staff.</p>

<p>“The boy bâboo seeing him, rushed up and called out
aloud:</p>

<p>“‘Oh, my lord, you are my father and my mother.
What shall I tell you? These wild Highlanders will not
hear me, but are stealing commissariat biscuits like fine fun!’</p>

<p>“Sir Colin pulled up, and tried not to smile. ‘Is there
no officer here?’ he asked.</p>

<p>“The bâboo replied: ‘No officer, sir&mdash;my lord&mdash;only
one very big corporal, and he tell me grandly “Shut up,
you! or I’ll shoot you, same like rebel mutineer.”’</p>

<p>“Hearing this, I stepped out of the crowd, and, saluting
Sir Colin, told him that this cart had broken down, and
as there were no other means of carrying the biscuits, the
men had filled their haversacks with them rather than
leave them on the ground.</p>

<p>“Then the bâboo again came to the front with clasped
hands, saying: ‘Oh, my lord if one cart of biscuits
short, Major Fitzgerald not listen to me; rather order
thirty lashes with Provost Marshal’s cat. Oh, what can
a poor bâboo do with such supreme and wild Highlanders?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sir Colin replied: ‘Yes, bâboo, I know these Highlanders
are very wild fellows when they are hungry.
Let them have the biscuits,’ and turning to one of the
staff, he directed him to give a voucher to the bâboo that
a cart loaded with biscuits had broken down, and the
contents had been divided amongst the rearguard by
order of the Commander-in-Chief. Sir Colin then turned
to us and said: ‘Men, I give you the biscuits. Divide
them with your comrades in front; but you must promise
me should a cart loaded with rum break down, you
will not interfere with it.’</p>

<p>“We all replied: ‘No, no, Sir Colin; if rum breaks
down, we’ll not touch it.’</p>

<p>“‘All right,’ said Sir Colin, ‘remember! I trust you,
and I know every one of you.’</p>

<p>“We honestly shared those biscuits, and it was well
we had them, for about five miles further on a general
halt was made for a short rest and for all stragglers to
come up. Sir Colin ordered the 93rd to form up, and
calling the officers to the front, he announced to the
regiment that General Wyndham had been attacked by
the Nana Sahib and by the Gwalior contingent in Cawnpore;
that his force had been obliged to retire within the
fort at the bridge of boats; and that we must reach Cawnpore
that night, because if the bridge of boats should be
captured before we got there, we should be cut off in Oude,
with 50,000 of our enemies in our rear, a well-equipped
army of 40,000 men in our front, together with a powerful
train of artillery numbering over forty siege-guns to
face, and with all the women and children, sick and
wounded, to guard. ‘So, 93rd,’ said the old chief, ‘I
don’t ask you to undertake this forced march in your
present tired condition without good reason. You must
reach Cawnpore to-night at all costs.’</p>

<p>“As usual, when he took the men into his confidence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
he was answered from the ranks: ‘All right, Sir Colin,
we’ll do it.’ And we did.”</p>

<p>By this time they could hear the guns of the Gwalior
contingent bombarding General Wyndham’s position in
Cawnpore. Although terribly footsore and tired, not
having had their clothes off for eighteen days, they
trudged on their weary march, every mile hearing the guns
more clearly. There is nothing to rouse tired soldiers
like a good cannonade in front. It is the best tonic out.</p>

<p>But they will never forget the misery of that march.
They reached the sands on the banks of the Ganges, on
the Oude side of the river opposite Cawnpore, just as the
sun was setting, having covered the forty-seven miles
under thirty hours. And when they got in sight of
Cawnpore the first thing they saw was the enemy on the
other side of the river making bonfires of their spare kit
and baggage, which had been left at Cawnpore when they
advanced for the relief of Lucknow.</p>

<p>How on the 29th of November they crossed the bridge
of boats; how by the 3rd of December all the women
and children and wounded were on their way to Allahabad;
how they smashed up the famous Gwalior contingent
and sent the Nana flying into the desert&mdash;all this
belongs to another story. Sir Colin thanked his old
regiment for their great toil and prowess. “But we
old soldiers should like our deeds and the deeds of those
who gave their lives for England to be remembered by
our children’s children, and to be studied with a grateful
sympathy.”</p>

<span class="smaller">RUNNING THE BLOCKADE (1861)</span></h2>

<p class="summary">North <i>v.</i> South&mdash;A new President hates slavery&mdash;Fort Sumter is
bombarded&mdash;Ladies on the house-top&mdash;Niggers don’t mind shells&mdash;A

<p>In November, 1860, Abraham Lincoln was elected President
of the United States. As the new President was in
sympathy with those who wished to abolish slavery,
and as the Southern States were mostly inhabited by
large landholders possessing thousands of slaves, this
election was felt to doom their ascendancy unless they
could resist the will of the North. Therefore, on the
17th of December a convention of the State of South
Carolina was held at Charleston, which formally repealed
their acceptance of the United States Constitution.</p>

<p>Neither side at first foresaw the results of secession.
Each thought the other would offer little resistance. The
North were totally unprepared for war; the South were
weakened by internal dissensions, but they fought as
long as they had any soldiers left, and at last “robbed the
cradle and the grave.” The South were in the end quite
exhausted, while the North seemed to gather new strength
every month. As the war went on the soldiers of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
South, or Confederates, wore out their clothes, and could
not replace them. Things were so scarce and dear that
it became a proverb, “In going to market, you take your
money in your basket and bring your purchases home in
your pocket.” Planters in the South had to borrow
money to support their hordes of negroes in idleness while
they themselves were away at the front.</p>

<p>On the 4th of March Lincoln formally entered on office.
Secession, he said, meant rebellion. The Constitution
must be preserved, if necessary, even by force.</p>

<p>Major Anderson, who held a small fort in Charleston
Harbour for the North, spiked his guns and moved into
Fort Sumter, also in the harbour. This was considered
an act of war, and Fort Sumter was bombarded and
taken. The little town was full of excited soldiers,
singing and shouting. We have a peep of what was
going on and what it felt like in Mrs. Chestnut’s diary
for the 12th of April:</p>

<p>“I do not pretend to go to sleep. How can I? If
Anderson does not accept terms at four the orders are
he shall be fired upon. I count four. St. Michael’s
bells chime out, and I begin to hope. At half-past four
the heavy booming of a cannon! I sprang out of bed,
and on my knees prostrate I prayed as I never prayed
before. There was a sound of stir all over the house,
pattering of feet in the corridors. All seemed hurrying
one way. I put on my double gown and went on the
house-top. The shells were bursting. The roar of the
cannon had begun. The women were wild there on the
house-top. Prayers came from the women and imprecations
from the men. Then a shell would light up the
scene, and we all wondered why Fort Sumter did not
reply.”</p>

<p>On the next day Fort Sumter was on fire. The warships
of the North were outside the bar, and could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
enter for want of depth of water. On the 15th Anderson
had to give the fort up to the South.</p>

<p>The slaves were taking it all very quietly, seemed not
much moved by the thought of being free&mdash;rather
preferred to be slaves and be well fed.</p>

<p>A negro was rowing in the bay towards Charleston
during the bombardment with some supplies from a plantation.
He was met and asked: “Are you not afraid
of Colonel Anderson’s cannon?”</p>

<p>“No, sar. Mars Anderson ain’t daresn’t hit me. He
knows marster wouldn’t ’low it.”</p>

<p>The next step taken by the President was to declare
all the Southern ports in a state of blockade, in order that
the seceding States might be starved out. The coast-line
was some 3,000 miles in length, and the whole fleet
of the United States did not reach 150 ships, of which
many were unseaworthy. But the energy of the North
increased this fleet to nearly 700 vessels. Thus any
attempt to run in through the blockading squadron was
very dangerous.</p>

<p>A royal proclamation in England admonished all loyal
subjects to respect the Federal blockade; but the high
profits to be made tempted many Liverpool firms to
adventure their argosies. A ship taken while running
the blockade is treated as an enemy, and if she resists
she is treated as a pirate.</p>

<p>During the first year of the war many captures were
made, and stories came to England of hairbreadth escapes
which set many young men longing to join in the exciting
game.</p>

<p>I remember a man coming to Oxford when I was an
undergraduate with a letter of introduction from a friend.
He was running into Charleston, and had brought from
that port a store of watches and jewellery, which he persuaded
us to take in exchange for a quantity of discarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
clothing. The lady’s gold watch which I got is, I hear,
still going strong, and belies the suspicion with which I
took it. At this time there were no mills, and almost no
manufactories in the Southern States, so that they soon
began to feel the want of clothes, buttons, boots, socks,
medicines, and chemicals. Nassau, a little island in
the Bahamas, was the chief base for the steamers that
were running the blockade. It is about 560 miles from
Charleston and 640 from Wilmington.</p>

<p>The Bahama group afforded neutral water to within
fifty miles of the American coast, but it required a very
fast vessel to succeed in evading the chain of cruisers
which soon patrolled the coast. These fast vessels were
being built in England and elsewhere. Let us follow the
fortunes of one of them&mdash;the <i>Banshee</i>.</p>

<p>She arrived safely across the Atlantic and put into
Nassau. There she was stripped for the work that lay
before her. Everything aloft was taken down, and
nothing was left standing but the two lower masts, with
cross-trees for a look-out man. The ship was painted a
dull white, and the crew wore a grey uniform. As the
success of a blockade-runner depends much on her speed,
the qualities of the engineer are important.</p>

<p>The <i>Banshee</i> possessed a model chief engineer in Mr.
Erskine, a man cool in danger and full of resource. In
her pilot, Tom Burroughs, she had a man who knew the
waters thoroughly, and was a genius in smelling out a
blockader on the darkest night. A good pilot received
about £800 for the trip there and back, for there was
some risk in the service, and if they were captured they
went to prison. The pay of the seamen was from £50
to £60 for the trip. So the <i>Banshee</i> stole out of Nassau
Harbour on a dark night, laden with arms, gunpowder,
boots, and clothing, on her way to Wilmington.</p>

<p>Wilmington lies to the north of Charleston, some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
sixteen miles up the Cape Fear River. Off the mouth of
this river lies Smith’s Island, which divides the approach
to the port into two widely different channels.</p>

<p>Fort Fisher, placed at the northern point, obliged
the blockaders to lie far out, beyond the range of the
guns. Further out still was a cordon of cruisers, and outside
these were gunboats always on the move; so that it
required speed and a good look-out to elude the three
lines of blockaders. They crept as noiselessly as possible
along the shores of the Bahamas, and ran on safely
for the first two days out, though as often as they saw
a sail on the horizon they had to turn the <i>Banshee’s</i> stern
to it till it vanished. The look-out man had a dollar for
every sail he sighted, and was fined five dollars if it were
seen first from the deck. On the third day they found
they had only just time to run under cover of Fort Fisher
before dawn, and they tried to do it.</p>

<p>“Now the real excitement began,” says Mr. Taylor,
who was in charge of the cargo, “and nothing I have
ever experienced can compare with it. Hunting, pig-sticking,
big-game shooting, polo&mdash;all have their thrilling
moments, but none can approach ‘running a blockade.’
Consider the dangers to be encountered, after three days
of constant anxiety and little sleep, in threading our way
through a swarm of blockaders, and the accuracy required
to hit in the nick of time the mouth of a river only half
a mile wide, without lights, and with a coast-line so low
that as a rule the first intimation we had of its nearness
was the dim white line of the surf.”</p>

<p>They steamed along cautiously until nightfall. Though
the night was dark it was dangerously clear. No lights,
not even a cigar. The hatchways of the engine-room
were covered with tarpaulins, and the poor stokers had
to breathe as best they could.</p>

<p>All hands were on deck, crouching down behind the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
bulwarks. On the bridge were Taylor, the captain,
Mr. Steele, and the pilot, all straining their eyes into the
“vasty deep.”</p>

<p>Presently the pilot muttered: “Better cast the lead,
captain.”</p>

<p>Steele murmured down the tube that led to the engine-room,
and the vessel slowed down and then stopped. A
weird figure crept into the fore-chains and dropped the
leaded line, while the crew listened to see if the engines
would seize the opportunity to blow off steam and so
advertise their presence for miles around. In two minutes
came the seaman, saying: “Sixteen fathoms, sir. Sandy
bottom, with black specks.”</p>

<p>“We are not so far in as I thought,” said the pilot.
“Port two points and go a little faster.”</p>

<p>He knew by the speckled bottom where they were.
They had to be north of that before it was safe to head
for the shore.</p>

<p>In an hour or less the pilot asked for another sounding.
No more specks this time. “Starboard and go ahead
easy” was the order now.</p>

<p>The paddle-floats were flapping the water softly, but
to the crew the noise they made was terrifying. They
could be heard a long way.</p>

<p>Suddenly the pilot said: “There’s one of them, Mr.
Taylor, on the starboard bow.”</p>

<p>Presently straining eyes could see a long, low, black
object lying quite still. Would she see the <i>Banshee</i>?</p>

<p>They passed within a hundred yards of her and were
not heard.</p>

<p>Soon after Burroughs whispered: “Steamer on the
port bow.”</p>

<p>A second cruiser was made out close to them.</p>

<p>“Hard a port,” said the captain, and the steamer
swung round, bringing the enemy upon her beam. No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
sound! The enemy slept! Then suddenly a third
cruiser came out of the gloom and steamed slowly across
the <i>Banshee’s</i> bows.</p>

<p>“Stop her,” said Captain Steele down the tube, and
the blockade-runner gurgled to a standstill, while the
cruiser moved across and was lost in the darkness.</p>

<p>Then “Slow ahead” was the order, until the low-lying
coast and the grey surf came dim to the eye. But it was
getting near dawn, and there was no trace of the river
mouth.</p>

<p>They knew not quite where they were, and thoughts
of prison and prison fare would come uppermost.</p>

<p>At length the pilot said: “All right, boys. I can see
the big hill yonder.”</p>

<p>The only hill on the coast was near Fort Fisher. Now
they knew where they were; so did six or seven gunboats,
which, in the silver light of early dawn, catching
sight of their prey, steamed hard and fast towards the
<i>Banshee</i>, with angry shots from the bow gun. The balls
were dropping all around and churning up the sea. It
was mighty unpleasant to men who knew they had several
tons of gunpowder in the hold; and just then they were
obliged to steer out to avoid the North Breaker shoal,
so that the gunboats crept ever nearer and nearer, barking
like disappointed puppies.</p>

<p>The pilot looked at the captain and the captain at the
supercargo. Their lips tightened and their breath came
faster as they eyed the gunboats askance.</p>

<p>“One good shot into the paddle will end this trip,”
thought Mr. Taylor; “and it is my first run in, too!”</p>

<p>Then came a welcome sound overhead. A shell from
the fort whirred its way towards the gunboats and
warned them off.</p>

<p>With a parting broadside they sheered off out of range,
and after half an hour’s run the <i>Banshee</i> was over the bar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
and in quiet waters. They soon sped up the sixteen
miles to Wilmington, and found a large posse of willing
slaves ready to discharge their cargo.</p>

<p>The poor folk at Wilmington were then very much
pinched for want of good food and drink, and the advent
of the <i>Banshee</i> restored smiles all round. Living on corn-bread,
bacon, and water grows monotonous, and invitations
to lunch on board the <i>Banshee</i> were never declined&mdash;in
fact, many friends did not even wait for an invitation.</p>

<p>Within a very few days the <i>Banshee</i> was again ready
for sea, ballasted with tobacco and laden with cotton&mdash;three
tiers even on deck! High profit tempted them to
pile up their vessels like hay-waggons, and put to sea in
a condition quite unfit to meet a boisterous wind.</p>

<p>It was fortunately more easy to run out than to run in,
as there was no harbour mouth to find in the dark, and
the open sea lay before them. They learnt that the
Admiral’s ship remained at anchor during the night, while
the other vessels moved slowly to and fro across the
mouth of the river; so they formed a bold plan, thinking
that security lay in a startling impudence. They hid
the <i>Banshee</i> behind Fort Fisher till nightfall, rowing
ashore to get the latest news from Colonel Lamb, who
commanded the fort.</p>

<p>“Which, sir, is the Admiral’s flag-ship?”</p>

<p>“The <i>Minnesota</i>, a sixty-gun frigate. Don’t go too
near her.”</p>

<p>“That is just what we mean to do, Colonel; but first
we will take her bearings exactly. We don’t want to
bump into her.”</p>

<p>The Colonel was very kind and helpful, and they often
enjoyed his society and that of his wife, who lived in a
cottage not far off.</p>

<p>As soon as night fell over the sea the <i>Banshee</i> slipped
quietly from her secret anchorage, crossed the river bar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
and following the observations they had taken, ran close
by the flagship, and so out to sea, clear of the first cordon.
But in trying to pass the second they ran across a gunboat,
which at once opened fire. The men lay down on
the deck, and the engines throbbed and thumped.
Luckily the gunboat was very slow, and they soon lost
one another; but as they could hear her pounding along
behind, they attempted a ruse. The helm was put hard
over, so that they steamed in a direction at right angles
to their former course, and in a few minutes their engines
were stopped. The <i>Banshee</i> lay perfectly still. The
crew rose on their elbows and peeped over the bulwarks,
following the course of the gunboat by the flashes of her
guns and by the rockets she was sending up madly to
attract or warn her consorts. So they saw her go plunging
past them and firing madly into the dark abyss of
the night.</p>

<p>After resting five minutes on the heaving wave, the
<i>Banshee</i> started again as noiselessly as she could. One
danger remained&mdash;the third cordon. You may be sure
they stared wide-eyed round the horizon as morning
broke. With the <i>Banshee</i> so heavily laden it would be
fatal to meet a cruiser in the daylight.</p>

<p>No smoke visible&mdash;no sail! All that day and for
two days more they steamed on with fear beside them.
On the evening of the third day they steamed proudly
into Nassau, though a heavy list to starboard made them
present a rather drunken appearance.</p>

<p>The profits of blockade-running may be estimated by
the fact that though the <i>Banshee</i> afterwards became a
total loss by capture, she earned enough on her eight successful
trips to pay the shareholders 700 per cent. on their
investment. The Northerners turned her into a gunboat,
but she asserted her sympathies for the South by running
foul of the jetty in the naval yard at Washington.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p>On another run in the <i>Night Hawk</i>, after getting safely
through the blockading fleet, they grounded on the
bar, and two launches speedily boarded them. The
Northerners were very excited, and evidently expected
to meet with desperate resistance, for firing of revolvers
and wild cutlass blows surprised the crew of the <i>Night
Hawk</i>, who stood quietly on the poop waiting to be taken
prisoners.</p>

<p>“This roused my wrath,” says Taylor, “and I expostulated
with the Lieutenant upon his firing on unarmed
men.”</p>

<p>They then cooled down and began a search for portable
valuables; but, perhaps because they feared Colonel
Lamb might come to the rescue, they made haste about
this, and then set fire to the ship fore and aft.</p>

<p>They were quickened in their departure by the humour
of an Irish fireman, who sang out lustily:</p>

<p>“Begorra! begorra! but we shall all be in the air in a
minute, with this ship full of gunpowder!”</p>

<p>The men who were holding Taylor dropped him “like
a hot potato,” and away they rowed, taking some of the
crew as prisoners. The gunpowder existed only in the
fancy of the Irishman.</p>

<p>The blockaders opened fire on the <i>Night Hawk</i>, which
was blazing merrily, and Colonel Lamb shelled the
blockading fleet; then through the boiling surf the rest
of the crew rowed safely, wet through and exhausted.</p>

<p>With the rising tide she bumped herself over the sandbank,
still burning. They telegraphed to Wilmington
for help, and some 300 negroes came down the river to
assist in baling and pumping. So they managed to save
the <i>Night Hawk</i> and make her fit to undertake other
voyages, though to look at she was no beauty, for her
sides were all corrugated with the heat, and her stern
twisted, and not a bit of woodwork on her was left un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>consumed
by the fire. Yet she managed to stagger
across the Atlantic through some very bad weather.</p>

<p>Such were some of the adventures of the blockade-runners
in the Civil War of the United States. To those
who bought the ships it was a matter of pecuniary profit
merely; to the Southerners in Richmond, Wilmington,
and Charleston, and even on the plantations inland, the
arrival of these vessels staved off famine and cold and
nakedness. To the Northerners they meant a prolongation
of the unequal struggle, and it was no wonder that
they dealt rather harshly with those whom they caught.</p>

<p>A rich lady of South Carolina wrote during this war:
“I have had an excellent pair of shoes given me. For
more than a year I have had none but some dreadful
things made by our carpenter, and they do hurt my feet
so. Uncle William says the men who went into the war
to save their negroes are abjectly wretched. Neither
side now cares a fig for these beloved negroes, and would
send them all to heaven in a hand-basket to win the
fight.”</p>

<p>The negroes on the whole were very faithful to their
old masters, for many of them had been treated with all
justice and kindness. Of course, some of them gave
themselves airs on becoming free and independent voters.
One old negro said to his master: “When you all had de
power you was good to me, and I’ll protect you now,
massa. No niggers nor nobody shall tech you. If you
want anything, call for Sambo. Ahem! I mean call for
Mr. Samuel: dat my name now.”</p>

<p>The War of Secession between the Federals and Confederate
States gave rise to a new kind of warship&mdash;the
ironclad. The <i>Merrimac</i> was converted into such a
vessel by the South, and the <i>Monitor</i> was built by the
North, or Federals, in the space of 100 days.</p>

<p>Most people, experts and others, predicted a watery
grave for a ship cased in iron. Very few ventured on
board at the launching of the <i>Monitor</i>, and even the
builders provided a steam-tug to save the passengers
in case she went to the bottom. But the <i>Monitor</i>, after
the first graceful dip, sat like a wild duck on a mere, being
flat-bottomed, having a turret 9 feet high, capable of
revolving, with two circular portholes to fire from.
Captain Ericsson, a Swede, was her architect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>The South had seized all the forts and dockyards below
Chesapeake Bay, and had struck great consternation into
the Federal hearts. When the Federals burnt and
evacuated the Norfolk Navy Yard they scuttled the
steam frigate <i>Merrimac</i>; but the Confederates raised her,
plated her with railroad iron, and fitted her with a slanting
roof to serve as a shield. The <i>Merrimac</i>, when
finished, did not take the water so gracefully as the
<i>Monitor</i>, for her weight was so enormous that she nearly
broke her back in launching. It was known that both
sides were at work upon some monster of the deep, but
which would be ready first no one could predict.</p>

<p>However, on the 8th of March the <i>Merrimac</i> left Norfolk,
accompanied by two other war vessels&mdash;the <i>Jamestown</i>
and <i>Yorktown</i>&mdash;and followed by a little fleet of
armed tugs. She was heading for Newport News,
where there was a Federal garrison, guarded by the
sailing frigates the <i>Cumberland</i> and the <i>Congress</i>, which
rode at anchor within half a mile of the shore battery.
Their boats were hanging at the booms, and the week’s
washing fluttered in the rigging&mdash;as peaceful a scene as
could be imagined.</p>

<p>But the look-out on Fortress Monroe caught sight of a
monster vessel ploughing the waves, and signalled to
the war-ships to get under way. The <i>Minnesota</i> had
her steam up and soon went off towards Newport News,
where the <i>Cumberland</i> and <i>Congress</i> lay on blockading
duty. The crew of the <i>Cumberland</i>, seeing a strange ship
come round Craney Island, recognized her as the expected
ironclad. All hands were beat to quarters, and
the <i>Cumberland</i> swung across the channel in order to
bring her broadside to bear. The slanting roof of the
<i>Merrimac</i> puzzled them, and the long iron ram churned
up the water as she advanced relentlessly and in silence.
At the distance of a mile the <i>Cumberland</i> began to use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
her pivot guns, but the <i>Merrimac</i> made no reply, only
steamed majestically on, though broadside after broadside
was poured upon her like hail; but the heavy shot
glanced off harmlessly, and ever the <i>Merrimac</i> came
closer and closer.</p>

<p>As she passed the <i>Congress</i> the <i>Merrimac</i> fired one broadside,
and then, leaving her to the tender mercies of the
<i>Jamestown</i> and the <i>Yorktown</i>, made straight for the
<i>Cumberland</i>. Both the Federal ships discharged their
broadsides against the armoured monster. She just
quivered under the blow and came on in silence. The
National battery at Newport News opened upon her at
point-blank range, and every man on board the <i>Cumberland</i>
drew a breath of relief. “Now,” they thought, “our
massive guns will teach her a lesson.” But it seemed as
if the <i>Merrimac</i> had received no damage. Not a soul
could be seen on her decks, not a splinter on her sides;
but she was coming towards them&mdash;coming madly, as it
seemed, to destruction.</p>

<p>What did the <i>Merrimac</i> mean? Why did she not fire
her guns? The crew on the <i>Cumberland</i> soon found out,
when the great ram struck their frigate amidships with
a shock that threw every man down on the deck, crushed
in the ribs, and heeled the ship over till her topsail yards
almost splashed the water. The <i>Merrimac</i> reversed her
engines and backed away under a murderous broadside,
replying as she too turned her broadside with a deadly
volley of shot and shell, which swept her enemy’s decks
of guns and men. Meanwhile the water was pouring into
the terrible gaping wound in the side of the <i>Cumberland</i>;
but Lieutenant Morris, who was in command, fought her
to the last with unflinching courage. Yet once again the
<i>Merrimac</i> turned her prow and crushed in close upon the
old wound, and the great oak ribs snapped like twigs
under the weight of iron. The <i>Cumberland</i> began to ride<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
lower in the water, but still aimed with calm accuracy at
the <i>Merrimac</i>, riddling her smoke-stack and bending her
anchor. But the <i>Merrimac</i> lay off a little and poured a
storm of shot into the sinking frigate, dealing death and
mutilation. Yet Morris refused to yield, and the whole
crew in their desperate plight thought of nothing but
saving the honour of the flag. One sailor, with both his
legs shot off, hobbled up to his gun on bleeding stumps
and pulled the lanyard, then fell in a swoon by the gun.</p>

<p>“She is sinking!” was the cry; but they still fought on,
though the frigate was settling deeper every minute.
Then the water came gurgling into the portholes, and
choked the guns and drowned the gunners. The last
gunner was knee-deep in water when he fired the last
shot, and then the <i>Cumberland</i> careened over on her side.
Down she sank amid a whirl of circling waters, a caldron
of wave and air&mdash;caught in one, and vomiting steam all
around and over the dying vessel, and in a moment
400 men were on the verge of death, some being carried
down into the revolving vortex, some being cast up on
the outside, some swimming frantically towards the
shore, or reaching desperately for fragments of wreck.
About 100 went down with the ship. The chaplain went
down with the wounded who were below deck.</p>

<p>It took forty-five minutes for the <i>Merrimac</i> to finish
off the <i>Cumberland</i>, and she now turned her ram towards
the <i>Congress</i>, which spread all sail and endeavoured to get
clear away.</p>

<p>But at this moment the <i>Congress</i> grounded and became
helpless. The gunboats of the Confederates were still
firing heavily at her from a respectful distance, but as
they saw the <i>Merrimac</i> approaching they too drew near
under her protection.</p>

<p>The <i>Merrimac</i> chose her position at about 100 yards’
range, despising the guns of the <i>Congress</i>, and raked her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
fore and aft, dismounting guns and covering her deck
with mangled limbs. In three places the <i>Congress</i> burst
into flames, and the dry timber crackled and blazed and
smoked like a volcano. The men could not stand by the
guns for the fervent heat. The wounded were slowly
burned alive. The officers could not bear this sight, and
hauled down the flag.</p>

<p>A tug was sent by the Confederates to take off the
prisoners from the burning wreck, but, unfortunately,
some sharpshooters from the shore still kept up a hot fire
upon the Southern vessels. In consequence of this the
<i>Merrimac</i> fired another broadside into the sinking <i>Congress</i>,
and killed many more of her crew. The <i>Congress</i>,
being deserted, still burned on till darkness fell, and the
ruddy glare lit up the moving waters as if they had been
a sea of blood. At midnight the fire reached her magazine,
and with a thunder of explosion the <i>Congress</i> blew
up into a myriad fragments. The Northern warship
<i>Minnesota</i> had also grounded, so had the frigate <i>St. Lawrence</i>,
and the <i>Merrimac</i>, while it was still light enough to
aim a gun, steamed towards them to see what little
attention she could bestow upon them. The <i>Merrimac</i>
was, perhaps, a little overconfident in her coat of mail.
Anyhow, she risked receiving a broadside at very short
range from the heavy guns of the <i>Minnesota</i>.</p>

<p>A shot seems to have entered her porthole and damaged
her machinery, for she hesitated, put about, and returned
to safe anchorage behind Craney Island.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a very natural terror was gnawing at the
hearts of the Federal crews and garrison in Hampton
Roads.</p>

<p>They had listened to the sounds of the conflict and seen
the dire results in wonder, almost in despair. The
<i>Merrimac</i>, they said, was invulnerable. Not a shot could
pierce her. On Sunday morning she would return and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
destroy the whole Federal fleet at her leisure. She would
shell Newport News Point and Fortress Monroe, at the
entrance of Hampton Roads, set everything on fire, and
drive the garrisons from their guns. Nay, as the telegraph
wires flashed the news to Washington, it was
foreseen with an agony of horror that the <i>Merrimac</i> might
ascend the Potomac and lay the capital in ashes. Baltimore,
Philadelphia, New York, Boston, were in a state of
panic. No one knew what might not follow. It was a
blind horror of a new and unknown danger. For the
experience of one hour had rendered the shipbuilding of
the past a scorn and a laughing-stock. Wooden frigates
might go to the scrap-heap now. With the <i>Cumberland</i>
had gone down morally all the great navies of Europe. A
new order had to be found for ship and battery, and steel
must take the place of planks of oak.</p>

<p>Such a night of anxiety and alarm the Northern States
had never experienced. It was ten o’clock at night when
the look-out in the garrison thought he saw lights out at
sea in Chesapeake Bay. He called his mate. By-and-by
they made them out to be two small steamers heading
for Old Point Comfort. An eye-witness from Fort
Monroe thus describes what happened:</p>

<p>“Oh, what a night that was! I can never forget it.
There was no fear during the long hours&mdash;danger, I find,
does not bring that&mdash;but there was a longing for some
interposition of God and waiting upon Him, from whom
we felt our help must come, in earnest, fervent prayer,
while not neglecting all the means of martial defence.
Fugitives from Newport News kept arriving. Ladies
and children had walked the long ten miles from Newport
News, feeling that their presence only embarrassed their
brave husbands. Sailors from the <i>Congress</i> and <i>Cumberland</i>
came, one of them with his ship’s flag bound about
his waist, as he had swum with it ashore. Dusky fugitives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
came mournfully fleeing from a fate worse than death&mdash;slavery.
These entered my cabin hungry and weary.
The heavens were aflame with the burning <i>Congress</i>. But
there were no soldiers among the flying host. The
sailors came only to seek another chance at the enemy,
since the <i>Cumberland</i> had gone down in deep waters, and
the <i>Congress</i> had gone upward, as if a chariot of fire, to
convey the manly souls whose bodies had perished in that
conflict upward to heaven.</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">“The heavy night hung dark the hills and waters o’er,”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>but the night was not half so heavy as our hearts, nor so
dark as our prospects. All at once a speck of light
gleamed on the distant wave. It moved; it came nearer
and nearer, and at ten o’clock at night the <i>Monitor</i>
appeared.</p>

<p>“‘When the tale of bricks is doubled, Moses comes!’</p>

<p>“I never more firmly believed in special Providence
than at that hour. Even sceptics for the moment were
converted, and said: ‘God has sent her!’ But how
insignificant she looked! She was but a speck on the
dark blue sea at night, almost a laughable object by
day. The enemy call her ‘a cheese-box on a raft,’ and
the comparison is a good one. Could she meet the
<i>Merrimac</i>? The morrow must determine, for, under
God, the <i>Monitor</i> is our only hope now.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Worden, the Commander of the <i>Monitor</i>, on
arriving at Fort Monroe was instructed to lie alongside
the <i>Minnesota</i>, to guard her in case of a night attack.
At eleven o’clock she set out, and her arrival was hailed
with delight by the men on board the frigate, though
some shook their heads at the strange unshapely toy
which a private individual had constructed to save the
Federal fleet. But few slept that night. The odds
against the <i>Monitor</i> seemed too great. She mounted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
but two guns, while the <i>Merrimac</i> carried ten. Sunday
morning broke sunny and beautiful, and the sea was
peaceful and calm. Near Sewell’s Point, opposite Hampton
Roads, three vessels were at anchor, one of them the
<i>Merrimac</i>.</p>

<p>About nine o’clock glasses showed a stir amongst them,
and instantly the <i>Monitor</i> awoke to life and action,
closing her iron hatches and putting on the dead-light
covers. The <i>Monitor</i>, like a great girdle-cake, only stood
2 feet out of the water; her smooth surface was broken
only by the turret and pilot-house.</p>

<p>Then they saw the <i>Merrimac</i> coming, looking like a
submerged house, with roof only out of the water. After
her came the <i>Jamestown</i> and <i>Yorktown</i>, and a fleet of tug-boats
crowded with ladies and gentlemen from Norfolk
eager to see the fun.</p>

<p>The <i>Merrimac</i>, entirely unconscious of the new enemy
she had to encounter, steamed slowly along and fired
upon the <i>Minnesota</i>, which was still aground. The
<i>Minnesota</i> replied with a broadside and the usual result;
but the <i>Monitor</i> steamed out from behind and boldly
advanced to meet her antagonist, and when at a distance
of half a mile Lieutenant Worden from the pilot-house
gave the order to fire. The ball, weighing 170 pounds,
rattled against the mailed side of the <i>Merrimac</i>. She
staggered under the force of the concussion, and at once
seemed to realize that in this floating turret she had no
mean antagonist. At the range of only a few yards she
poured in a terrible broadside. To her disgust, the shots
seemed to have glided off and done no harm. Then the
two vessels closed and poured a hail of heavy metal
upon each other. The <i>Monitor</i> being the quicker, would
circle round the <i>Merrimac</i>, while the turret, turning with
ease, always presented the guns to the foe.</p>

<p>Worden in his pilot-house could speak through tubes to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
Lieutenant Green, who commanded the gunners in the
tower. Once Green trained his guns on the <i>Merrimac’s</i>
water-line, and the shot penetrated.</p>

<p>“Splendid, sir! splendid!” roared Worden. “You
have made the iron fly.”</p>

<p>But the spectators who lined the ramparts of Fort
Monroe could not see what was happening for the clouds
of smoke, and they stood, silent and wretched, almost
afraid to look.</p>

<p>But at last the veil parted, and they saw the little
<i>Monitor</i> lying alongside the <i>Merrimac</i>, trim and spiteful,
with the Stars and Stripes flying proudly from her stern,
and a great cheer arose from every throat. Then they
saw the <i>Merrimac</i> bear down upon the little flat cheese, as
if to sink her. She struck fair and square, but the iron
ram glided up on her low-sheathed deck and simply
careened her over; but in so doing the <i>Merrimac</i> showed
her unarmed hull below the iron coat of mail, and the
<i>Monitor</i> planted one of her shots in a vital place.</p>

<p>For four long hours had this strange duel lasted, the
<i>Merrimac</i> firing heavily, the <i>Monitor</i> steaming round and
choosing her place and time, with careful aim at rudder,
screw, and water-line. At last Buchanan, the Commander
of the <i>Merrimac</i>, was severely wounded, and as
his ship began to take in water through three gaping
wounds, the helm was put over and the conqueror of
yesterday limped away. But her last shot struck point-blank
upon the iron grating of the pilot-house just where
Lieutenant Worden was looking out. The concussion
threw him down senseless, and minute pieces of iron and
powder were driven into his eyes, so that he was blinded.
When after a time he recovered his consciousness he asked:</p>

<p>“Have I saved the <i>Minnesota</i>?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, and whipped the <i>Merrimac</i>,” was the
reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then I care not what becomes of me,” murmured the
Lieutenant.</p>

<p>The <i>Merrimac</i> slowly made her way to a safe anchorage
under the batteries at Sewell’s Point. Here she signalled
for help, and tugs came up, took her in tow, and escorted
her to Norfolk. Her injuries were so severe that after
months of work upon her she never ventured to quit
her retreat, whereas the <i>Monitor</i> seemed but slightly
damaged. She had been hit twenty-two times, and only
showed slight indentations, but a ball striking full on
the pilot-house had bent a huge iron beam. The ram of
the <i>Merrimac</i> had torn off some of the plating from the
side of the <i>Monitor</i>. The latter drew only 10 feet of
water, and could go where the <i>Merrimac</i> could not
venture.</p>

<p>But though the <i>Merrimac</i> had fired her last shot, she
gave the North a great fright in the night which followed
the battle. At midnight thousands of people along the
coast were roused from their sleep by cries that came over
the water: “Fire! fire! For God’s sake, save us!”</p>

<p>The shore was soon lined by spectators, who stood
unable to get a boat to put out or help in any way. There
was the gunboat <i>Whitehall</i> roaring with flames, and the
dark figures of the crew were plainly visible on her deck,
either wrapped in red fire or jumping into the deep water
beneath.</p>

<p>The <i>Whitehall’s</i> shotted guns were going off here and
there through the thick crowds or clustering houses, and
one shell struck the hospital, making the inmates believe
that the <i>Merrimac</i> had returned. It transpired that a
red-hot shot had been thrown from the <i>Merrimac</i> during
the day and had lodged between the <i>Whitehall’s</i> timbers,
where the fire smouldered until late at night.</p>

<p>The general conclusion from this momentous fight
between the first ironclads was that “England’s naval<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
supremacy is gone for ever.” But men are more potent
than masses of metal. America and England have navies
now in comparison with which the <i>Merrimac</i> and <i>Monitor</i>
are but tin kettles. Yet we must remember that Russia,
too, a few months ago possessed a strong navy as far as
metal goes. But once again the Japanese proved to the
world that it is in the hearts of brave men, the science of
clever men, and the enduring patience of patriotic men,
that the issues of victory or defeat are mainly determined.</p>

<span class="smaller">CAPTURE OF NEW ORLEANS (1862)</span></h2>

<p class="summary">New Orleans and its forts&mdash;Farragut despises craven counsel&mdash;The
mortar-fleet in disguise&mdash;Fire-rafts rush down&mdash;A week of hot
gun-fire&mdash;A dash through the defences&mdash;The <i>Varuna’s</i> last shot&mdash;Oscar,

<p>New Orleans, on the Mississippi River, was the great
market of the South, a rich and powerful city of 200,000
inhabitants. Everything possible had been done to defend
it from the Northern arms. Sixty miles below New
Orleans the river makes a sharp bend, and here, fronting
each other on either side, stood the forts of Jackson and
St. Philip. These strong forts the Confederates had
seized, and the Federal fleet had to pass them on its way
to New Orleans. They were heavily armoured with 180
pieces of ordinance, but besides the forts the warships
would have to cut through an iron cable stretched across
the river and supported by seven hulks and rafts. Above
these were eighteen gunboats and floating batteries, with
fire-rafts and rams; so that the city felt itself tolerably
secure behind these obstructions, and laughed to scorn
any thought of being besieged. Besides, had not English
and French officers examined the forts and pronounced
the attempt to pass them madness? But Commodore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
Farragut, who was in command of the National fleet,
answered them in these words:</p>

<p>“You may be right, gentlemen, but I was sent here to
make the attempt. I came here to reduce or pass the
forts and to take New Orleans, and I shall try it on.”</p>

<p>The Federal mortar-fleet was getting ready for action.
Topmasts were lowered, all spars and booms unshipped,
the main-decks cleared, and armour of chain cables was
improvised to protect the gunners. The ships were
painted with mud to make them invisible. On the
17th of April the order was given to advance up-stream.
There was a thick forest on the western bank, a low bank
and marshy ground on the east. In order to confuse
the enemy, the masts and rigging of the Northerners were
festooned with leafy branches; others were sheathed
with reeds to blend with the background of the river-bank.
Five sloops of war waited behind the mortar-boats,
carrying 104 guns; 150 boats supplied with grapnel-ropes,
axes, and buckets, were ready to deal with the fire-ships.
And they soon had the work to do, for one dark
night a blazing raft came down upon them, lighting up
water and bank, trees and rushes; but the <i>Westfield</i>
dashed into the burning pile and turned her hose upon
it; and the boats leapt forth to hack and grapple and
plunge the burning timbers into the river. Then cheers
broke forth when the peril had been subdued.</p>

<p>At 9 a.m. of the 16th of April Fort Jackson threw a
shell into the Northern flotilla a mile off, and at once the
mortar-boats replied, sending their big shells with great
accuracy into the very ramparts. New Orleans, seventy-two
miles away, distinctly heard the thunder of the bombardment,
kept up for more than a week. The citadel
was set on fire, the walls cracked and shattered, and the
forts were flooded. The men on deck would fall down
and sleep in the midst of the great thunder, so exhausted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
were they by toil night and day. On the second day the
<i>Carleton</i> received a shell into her magazine, which exploded,
and she sank. At the end of a week, after all
this terrible storm of flying metal, only one man had been
killed and six wounded in the Federal fleet. But the
forts had not been silenced.</p>

<p>On the 24th of April, at 2 a.m., two red lights were run
up on the flag-ship, and very soon the fleet was under
way for the passage between the forts. As each ship
passed it delivered its broadside and swept on towards the
gunboats beyond. Fire-rafts kept floating down, and
the roar of 500 cannon shook the air.</p>

<p>The <i>Ithaca</i> was riddled by shot and fell behind. The
ram <i>Manasses</i> came down on the flag-ship, and Admiral
Farragut got aground while trying to avoid her. His
ship took fire from a fire-raft, but it was extinguished.</p>

<p>Captain Boggs in the <i>Varuna</i> sunk five gunboats one
after another, then his vessel’s sides were stove in by a
ram; but with his last broadside before he sank he disabled
her. A boy named Oscar was on board the <i>Varuna</i>,
only thirteen years old, and during the fight was very
busy passing ammunition to the gunners. All covered
with dirt and powder-begrimed, he was met by Captain
Boggs, who asked where he was running in such a hurry.</p>

<p>“To get a passing-box, sir. My other was smashed
by a ball.”</p>

<p>When the <i>Varuna</i> went down with her crew Boggs
missed the boy, and feared he was among the drowned.
But presently he saw the lad gallantly swimming towards
the <i>Oneida</i>, a neighbour ship. Oscar clambered on board,
dripping and grinning from ear to ear, as if he had just
enjoyed the finest fun in life. Seeing his Captain, he put
his hand to his forehead in the usual salute, and saying,
“All right, sir; I report myself on board,” shook off the
water and was ready for the next duty to hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p>On the morning of the 25th the Federal ships ranged up
near the city batteries and silenced their fire in a few
minutes. Soon the whole fleet was moored opposite New
Orleans, with the Stars and Stripes proudly flying from
every masthead, and the bands playing their national airs.</p>

<p>The citizens of New Orleans had rested in full persuasion
that they were absolutely safe behind their forts
and gunboats, and now that they saw the enemy actually
threatening their city, they were transported by a passion
of panic, mortification, and rage.</p>

<p>When they first heard that the forts had been passed
and that the Yankee ships were coming up the river, the
mob of the city became so desperate in their fury that
martial law had to be proclaimed. At least, they said,
these hated Yankees should not get the wealth of the
city, and they put the torch to everything that would
burn. Offices, banks, ships, cotton, piers, warehouses,
coal, and sugar&mdash;all were fired and consumed in one vast
conflagration. The river was dotted with floating
islands of flame, as richly freighted merchantmen were
fired and cut adrift.</p>

<p>The Confederate General Lovell and his troops were
withdrawn, as no reasonable promise of a successful
defence remained.</p>

<p>Two iron rams of immense power which had been in
building were destroyed before Admiral Farragut arrived.</p>

<p>As soon as the fleet appeared before the city some of
the citizens who favoured the Union foolishly expressed
their delight by cheers. Civil war is always conducted
with greater bitterness than war with a foreign Power.
These unfortunates were promptly shot down in the
street or on the quay.</p>

<p class="header">Shot down by their Fellow-Citizens</p>

<p>During the siege of New Orleans, some of those who favoured the North were
foolish enough to cheer when the Northern fleet arrived.</p></div>
</div>

<p>On the 26th of April the city was formally surrendered,
and a body of troops was landed to raise the Stars and
Stripes over the public buildings. Crowds of angry men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
followed the marines with hoot and yell, and were only
prevented from inflicting actual outrage by the fear of
being shelled from the ships. It is said that Captain
Bailey and his men on landing at the crowded pier were
jostled and jeered at by angry bands of rowdies. We
have to remember this when we pass judgment on
General Butler’s order to treat all ladies who insulted the
troops as disorderly women. We may wonder how the
Germans would have treated the French in Paris had the
Parisians dared to conduct themselves so outrageously.</p>

<p>General Butler writes thus to a friend: “We were
2,500 men in a city seven miles long by two to four wide,
of 150,000 inhabitants, all hostile, bitter, defiant, explosive&mdash;standing
literally on a magazine. The devil
had entered the hearts of the women to stir up strife in
every way. Every opprobrious epithet, every insulting
gesture, was made by these bejewelled, becrinolined and
laced creatures, calling themselves ladies, towards my
soldiers and officers from the windows of houses and in
the streets. How long do you think our flesh and blood
could have stood this?...”</p>

<p>It is clear that General Butler was as angry as the
ladies. The <i>Albany Journal</i> adds this fact: “Women
who have been regarded as the pattern of refinement and
good breeding not only assail our men with the tongue,
but with more material weapons. Buckets of slops are
emptied upon them as they pass, decayed oranges and
rotten eggs are hurled at them. The forbearance of our
troops is wonderful.”</p>

<p>Commander Porter had been left behind to receive the
capitulation of the forts Jackson and St. Philip, when
the Federal fleet steamed up to New Orleans. He pitched
a few shells into Fort Jackson, but there “was no response;
the fight had all been taken out of them.” On
the 28th a flag of truce from Fort Jackson came on board<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
the <i>Harriet Lane</i> with offer to surrender. When officers
of both sides were assembled in the cabin of the <i>Harriet
Lane</i> discussing the details of surrender, an officer came
below and informed Commander Porter that the Southern
battery <i>Louisiana</i> had been set on fire and was drifting
down upon them. She was a steam floating battery of
4,000 tons, mounting sixteen heavy guns. The battery
had been fired so quietly that no one suspected any such
thing until it blazed up, for flags of truce were flying upon
both forts and ships.</p>

<p>Porter proceeded with the conference as if nothing were
the matter. Soon another officer came down, reporting
that the battery, on fire from stem to stern, was drifting
down upon them.</p>

<p>Turning to the Confederate officers, Porter asked:
“Has she powder and loaded guns on board, gentlemen?”</p>

<p>“We presume so, but we know nothing of naval
matters here.”</p>

<p>Just at this moment the hot guns began to go off and
throw shot and shell at random amongst friends and foes.</p>

<p>Commander Porter, with severe coolness of manner,
only said: “Then we will go on with our business, gentlemen.
If you don’t mind the effect of the explosion which
is soon to come, we can stand it.”</p>

<p>Fortunately, the <i>Louisiana</i> drifted across towards
St. Philip, and exploded her magazine when just abreast
of it. The sound of the explosion was heard for miles
up and down the river. When the smoke cleared away
the battery had gone into fragments and sunk in the
Mississippi. If it had drifted upon the <i>Harriet Lane</i>, as
had been intended, and blown into smithereens the consulting
officers of both North and South, that would
have been a consequence of treachery almost worse than
the insults of the New Orleans ladies or the indiscreet
edict of General Butler.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>Fort Jackson had crumbled into powder under the
impact of the huge shells from the mortars. On the first
night of the bombardment the magazine was in such
danger that only wet blankets saved it from blowing up.
One bomb came leaping into the officers’ mess-room
when they were dining. With a thud and a rumble it
rolled under the very table. All rose and clustered in a
corner in some consternation, expecting to go skywards
with the crockery. They waited one minute, two
minutes. Not yet had death come! Then a young
officer crawled under the table and burst into a hearty
laugh.</p>

<p>“What is it, Jimmy?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you can go on with that Irish stew now. The
fuse is out.”</p>

<p>They returned to their dinners with such appetite as
they could. Fortunately, men who are living at high
pressure and strain, meeting death at every turn, are
easily moved to see the funny side of things.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE SIEGE OF RICHMOND (1862 <span class="smaller">AND</span> 1865)</span></h2>

surrenders&mdash;Friends once more.</p>

<p>The battle of Fair Oaks had been fought, and General
McClellan began to entrench himself in view of the siege
of Richmond. It had been a drawn battle: the South
had taken some guns, but the Federal forces were too
strong for them, and swamps, rough ground, and woods
all helped to throw the South into confusion. Upon a
field hardly a mile square were lying some 7,000 or 8,000
dead and wounded, many of them having been there for
twenty-four hours. Some had gone deep into the muddy
swamps and stuck fast there, dying or laying the foundation
of some terrible disease. Acres of forest had been
slashed, or cut about 5 feet from the ground, to prevent
the passage of troops and artillery.</p>

<p>The Southern Commander-in-Chief, General Johnston,
had been killed by a shell in this battle, but the substitution
of General Robert E. Lee as Commander led to great
reforms in the Confederate Army. Lee at once removed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
the camps from malarious swamps; he provided supplies
of wholesome provisions, and reclothed the hungry,
starving and mutinous men, so that in a few weeks they
looked stronger, fought better, and behaved as men under
discipline.</p>

<p>Every evening the countersign was given out, and
sentinels were posted to prevent spies crossing the
Chickahominy. In the Federal Army were men of many
nations&mdash;Scotch, Irish, German, Norsemen, and others.
It was told of an Irish sentinel that he stopped a
stranger.</p>

<p>“Halt! Who comes there?”</p>

<p>“Me&mdash;a friend of the chaplain.”</p>

<p>“Have ye the countersign?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Faith! an’ if ye were a friend of the divil and had
no counthersign ye couldn’t pass this way&mdash;not on no
account, sor.”</p>

<p>“But I tell you I am a friend of your chaplain, and I
forgot to ask him for the countersign. Don’t you see?”</p>

<p>“Is that it, sor? Then, be jabers! what’s to prevint
me giving to ye the counthersign, eh?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, I suppose, if you will be so kind.”</p>

<p>“Come closer, and, be jabers! I’ll just whisper it in
your ear. There! Now stand and answer. Who comes
here?”</p>

<p>“A friend.”</p>

<p>“A friend! Right! and maybe ye have the counthersign?”</p>

<p>“I have; it is ‘Good-night, mother.’”</p>

<p>“Quite correct, sor. Pass on, and good luck to ye!”</p>

<p>A long siege is such dull work that the Northerners
used to amuse themselves by chaffing the young negroes
when they caught them in the lines. Perhaps they would
give the nigger-boy a bit of food, then suddenly say:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sambo, what relation are you to Jeff Davis’s coachman?”</p>

<p>The black eyes would roll and the whites enlarge as the
grinning nigger replied:</p>

<p>“I ain’t no sort o’ connexion with that ere, sah.”</p>

<p>“You’re a Secesh, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“No, sah; I’m Union boy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, then we shall have to flog you, Sambo. Don’t
you know that in this part of McClellan’s army we are all
at heart good rebels?”</p>

<p>“Lord ha’ mercy! I never thought o’ that; and now
I do think on it, I do agree dat I am a bit of a rebel,
anyhow.”</p>

<p>Then all the listeners would burst out laughing at
poor Sambo, and he left the camp befogged and bewildered.</p>

<p>Once an old grey-headed negro came into camp, and
some young officers began to tackle him.</p>

<p>“Think we can take Richmond, boy?”</p>

<p>“Dar be right smart o’ men round here, but I dunno
’bout dar being able for to take Richmond, sah.”</p>

<p>“‘Right smart o’ men!’” said a Captain. “Why,
this is only a flea-bite to what’s coming to eat up the
rebel army. You’ll see them coming up like locusts.
Here’s McClellan with half a million around here, and
there’s Burnside down there, coming from Carolina with
a hundred thousand more, and General Banks with two
hundred thousand more, and General Fremont&mdash;why, he
can’t count his men he has so many!”</p>

<p>The old fellow opened his eyes wider and wider as the
list of imaginary armies was run over. Then, gazing up
intently in the officer’s face:</p>

<p>“Got all dem men?” he asked in a subdued voice.</p>

<p>“Yes, and more.”</p>

<p>The negro threw out his arms and ejaculated:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh! dear Mesopotamia! Whatever will become of
massa, I wonder?”</p>

<p>The negroes wanted to be free, but they did not want
to work. Many of them who had run away from their
masters were employed by the Federals in unloading
stores. They worked from daylight until dark, singing
over it, talking, shouting, arguing, making such a shindy.
A Virginian negro never did a quarter of a day’s work on
his master’s plantations, and they soon found out the
difference when they became free niggers and earned
wages. They did not much relish their rise. A party of
niggers would come up to the Colonel’s tent.</p>

<p>“Well, boys, what made you leave your master?
Wasn’t he kind to you?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, massa berry kind&mdash;berry kind indeed.”</p>

<p>“Well, didn’t he give you enough to eat?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, plenty of dat, plenty of dat&mdash;’nuff to eat.”</p>

<p>“Well, boys, what made you leave him?”</p>

<p>“Why, de trufe am dat he made us work ’mong sugar-canes,”
said one.</p>

<p>“And we heerd ’bout de Norf am such a nice place, so
we tort dat we would go to um,” said another.</p>

<p>“Nice place? Why, how do you mean a nice place?”</p>

<p>“Well, sah, we was told dat nobody did no work up
dar.”</p>

<p>Even the white peasants in Virginia seemed to be lazy
and indolent. They lived in little cabins, and only the
very young or old were left, as every able-bodied man was
in the army. They were dressed in homespun and spoke
with a drawl. They did not wish to be richer, content
with one acre and a single cow&mdash;Tories of a most old-fashioned
kind; and the women, like the Boers, were
far more dangerous rebels than the men, and tried to
entrap unwary Federals when they got them drinking in
their houses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>All round by the river four miles from Richmond was
a succession of dark swamp, yellow field, and brown
hill-side. Batteries were placed on all the ridges, guarded
on either side by woods and in front by earthworks.
The Confederates on the other side of the river had fewer
trees but stronger earthworks. On the 1st of June there
was an artillery duel, begun by the Richmond batteries,
but they had to beat a retreat into the woods before the
precision of some German gunners. Sometimes the
pickets of both armies were so close to each other that
they made an agreement not to fire at one another.
Then they got to exchanging newspapers and tobacco,
telling the news, and altogether behaving as if they were
rational human beings, and not machines sent to kill
one another for political ideals far beyond their ken.
Once when a New Jersey regiment was upon picket
Federal scouts were being served with their allowance of
coffee, and one of these latter observing a Southerner
gazing wistfully at his smoking cup, beckoned to him to
come over and have a drink. He came, drank, smacked
his lips, and walked slowly back. Then he looked round
and said:</p>

<p>“I say, friend, how many times a month do you fellows
get this good coffee?”</p>

<p>“Oh, just three times a day,” said the Jersey man.</p>

<p>“Three times a day! Why, if that’s true I’ll not stay
a day longer in the Confederate Army. Here, lad, I give
myself up.” And the fellow actually let his friend take
him prisoner.</p>

<p>On the 20th of June General McClellan reported that
he had 156,839 men, but he could get no reinforcements,
and the armies of the South were increasing. The rains
were making quagmires all around, and disease was rife
among the troops. About this time the Confederate
General Stuart led a successful raid with 1,200 horse and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
two pieces of artillery round the rear of the Federals,
driving in their cavalry pickets till he came to Garlick’s
Landing, where he destroyed two schooners and many
waggons and captured many prisoners. One Federal&mdash;a
German Dragoon&mdash;scorned to fly with his comrades,
and fought a duel with a Texan trooper. The German
was a veteran in the wars of Europe, and attacked the
Texan, who was a little in advance of his troop. Both
were skilled swordsmen, and while they fought the rest
pulled rein and looked on. The German sat his horse as
if he were a part of the animal and wielded his sword
with parry, cut, and thrust like lightning flash. The
Texan, on his fleet barb, wheeled swiftly round and
round, seeking in vain for an opening. At last the
Texan slashed the German’s shoulder, and as blood
spirted from the wound the Texans, looking on, raised a
cheer. But as quick as thought, with a back-stroke the
German cut through the sleeve and flesh of the Texan’s
left arm, and his blood began to flow. Then the Texan
backed his horse and spurred again upon his opponent,
making a lunge at his breast. This the Dragoon parried
with great dexterity, and brought down his sharp blade
upon the other’s shoulder. Thereat the Texan wheeled
his horse once more, drew a pistol and shot the Dragoon
through the heart.</p>

<p class="header">A Duel between a Texan and a German</p>

<p>After a successful raid by the Southerners, the Federals had almost all fled, but one&mdash;a
German dragoon&mdash;scorned to do so, and instead attacked a Texan. The other
Southerners let them fight a duel, and the German was having the best of it, when the
Texan drew a pistol and shot him dead.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Colonel Estran, a Prussian officer in the service of the
South, who witnessed this scene, but disapproved of the
Texan having recourse to his pistol, writes thus: “Much
moved by his fate, I ordered a grave to receive the remains
of the brave German trooper. We buried him in
his regimentals, with his trusty sword on his breast and
his pistols by his side. I then sent for the Texan, and,
after reprimanding him severely for his cowardly conduct,
I ordered him to seek service in some other corps, telling
him that I could not think of allowing a fellow of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
stamp to remain in my regiment. The Texan scowled
at me with his cat-like eyes, and, muttering a curse,
mounted his horse and rode away.”</p>

<p>I think some of us may deem that the Texan was
hardly treated by this Prussian officer who felt so indignant
at the shooting of the German trooper. The
Texan had received two severe wounds. He was not
bound to fight only with the sword. He carried pistols;
so did the German. Why? if they were not to be used,
why carry them? It was the Texan’s duty to kill the
German, and he did so. No wonder the poor fellow
muttered a curse.</p>

<p>Days of disaster were coming for the Northern Army.
They were spread along the river and through the swamps
for more than twenty miles. The South could sally out
of Richmond and strike any one point before support
could be sent up. Part of the army was north of the
river, part south. They dared not march on Richmond,
now so strongly fortified, and to retreat was fatal. General
Jackson had joined General Lee, and every day there was
fierce fighting. In the battle of Gaine’s Mill, where the
North lost twenty-two guns, the Federal General Butterfield
at a critical moment came coolly down the knoll in
the thick of a hot fire, and sword in hand, seized the
colours, waved them aloft, and so encouraged the valour
of his regiment, shouting:</p>

<p>“Your ammunition is never exhausted while you have
your bayonets; and use them to the socket, my boys!”</p>

<p>Seventy thousand men were hurling grape, canister,
and bullet against 30,000. It was one loud and continuous
roar. It was only gradually that it was forced
upon the Federal troops that they were beaten and were
in full retreat to the James River.</p>

<p>Battles are like games of chess. The great thing is
to bring as many pieces into play as you can and mass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
them on one or two points. The Federals had over
100,000 fighting men, but only 30,000 were engaged in
the battle of Gaine’s Mill.</p>

<p>On the 28th McClellan wrote to the Secretary for War:
“I have lost the battle because my force was too small.
If I save this army now I tell you plainly that I owe no
thanks to you or to any other person in Washington.
You have done your best to sacrifice this army.”</p>

<p>The Federal rearguard did their best to cover the retreat.
They blew up the ammunition which had to be
deserted, emptied the barrels of whisky and molasses, bent
the muskets, and dismantled the forsaken waggons.
But the roads were thronged with the sick and wounded,
and hundreds lay down to die in the awful sun.</p>

<p>Ever the victorious South were riding in upon them
and making havoc. On one of these charges General
Butterfield, seeing the utter misery and downheartedness
of the men, gathered together all the regimental
bands and placed them at the head of a brigade. In one
great burst of sound, which rose above the clamour of
the battle, they started “The Star-spangled Banner.”
With the first few notes the men’s spirits rose and a new
energy came to them. They stepped out and sang
lustily, and other regiments caught the brave infection
and cheered in chorus.</p>

<p>Such are the uses of music in war. In our own regiments
in the Boer War, when the men got weary with
the long march, a Colonel would shout to his sergeants:
“Have you any men who can sing? Put them in front.”
Then the regiment would step out and forget their
weariness.</p>

<p>The <i>Richmond Dispatch</i> describes the battle-field thus:
“Money was found abundantly among the slain. One
man found not less than 150 dollars in gold. One lucky
finder had no less than six chronometers ticking in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
pocket at the same time. Our men seemed to take great
delight in assuming Federal officers’ uniforms, and
strutted about serio-comically, much to the amusement
of powder-begrimed youths who sat lolling and smoking
in the shade. The cannon and arms captured in this
battle were numerous and of very superior workmanship.
The twenty-six pieces were the most beautiful we have
ever seen, while immense piles of guns could be seen on
every hand, many even hardly tarnished.”</p>

<p>The road to James River was strewn with stragglers,
tired to death. Hospitals were filled to overflowing.
When they came to White Oak Swamp Bridge there was
a block of waggons, cannon, ambulances, etc. Twenty
rows of waggons stood side by side; teamsters swore, and
horses gibbed, and officers shouted.</p>

<p>A Confederate officer, writing of the battle of Malvern
Hill, describes how the gunboats on the James River
helped the Federal retreat, how shot from rifled guns
came hurtling through the woods, tearing down the
largest trees. “We passed over four lines of our own
men who lay close to the ground and dare not rise to face
the grape and canister. Our men trampled them into
the mud like logs. One man in his haste to get out of
danger shoved me on one side, and just at that instant
a canister-shot tore his head off. As you may suppose,
I was not much vexed at his want of politeness. Early
next morning I rode over the battle-ground. I came upon
numbers of dead and dying horses&mdash;and the wounded!
One, a fair-haired Yankee boy of sixteen, was lying with
both legs broken, half of his body submerged in water, his
teeth clenched, his finger-nails buried in the flesh, his
whole body quivering with agony and benumbed with
cold. In this case my pity got the better of my resentment,
and I dismounted, pulled him out of the water
and wrapped him in my blanket, for which he seemed very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
grateful. One of the most touching things I saw was a
couple of brothers, both wounded, who had crawled
together, and one of them, in the act of arranging a pillow
for the other with a blanket, had fallen. They had died
with their arms around one another, and their cheeks
together. But your heart will sicken at these details,
as mine did at seeing them, and I will cease.”</p>

<p>The word “resentment” in this letter reveals the bitter
feeling that springs up when men of the same nation are
at war. The battle of Malvern Hill was the fiercest of
the seven days’ battles, and the loss on both sides was
terrible. When the troops came in sight of James River,
muddy current and low banks, they rushed down with
mad impetuosity. Many plunged into the stream in a
very frenzy of delight. Those who for hours had suffered
agonies from thirst now stood knee-deep in the water
and drank like fish. The horses were as delighted as the
men, and neighed to their friends. Here the troops
rested and enjoyed the supplies sent up from White
House. But a storm came on the 2nd of July and
changed all to mud and sticky surfaces; but the sound
gave up their tents to the wounded, and soon many
steamers took the poor victims of the fight to a more
comfortable abode.</p>

<p>McClellan had lost 15,000 men in the awful struggle
of the last seven days, but the South had suffered more
heavily, and Richmond was crowded with the wounded
and dying. The President thanked the General in a
letter, saying: “I am satisfied that yourself, officers, and
men have done the best you could.”</p>

<p>It was not until three years after this&mdash;in April, 1865&mdash;that
Richmond was evacuated by General Lee before
Generals Grant and Sheridan. President Davis was in
church when an orderly, splashed with mud, walked up
the aisle and handed him a paper. In the first glance he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
saw that all was over, and a few hours after he was in
full flight. On Monday morning Weitzel with his army,
composed partly of coloured troops, marched into Richmond
with bands playing. The city had been fired and
the stores plundered. Main Street was in ruins, and the
bridges over the river were broken. A thousand prisoners
were taken and 500 pieces of artillery.</p>

<p>It is said that the coloured troops entered Richmond
with proud gait and shouts of ecstasy, welcomed enthusiastically
by their dusky brethren who thronged the
streets. They laughed and shouted, prayed and wept,
and kissed one another in a delirium of happiness. They
thought that now at last the white races would acknowledge
their equality; but the world has not yet got
rid of its old prejudices, and their sun of happiness was
doomed to suffer an eclipse. In a few days Lee surrendered.
The Federals first heard the news from the
cheers of the poor famished army of the South. Twenty-two
thousand&mdash;all that was left of them&mdash;stacked their
arms and filed past in a great and solemn silence. The
cruel, devastating war was over. Now was seen the
strange spectacle of the enemy sharing their rations with
a conquered foe. They were no longer North and South
now: they were all Americans&mdash;citizens once more of
the United States, destined, perhaps, in a not distant
future to teach Europe that peace is better than war, love
is stronger than hate, God’s kingdom supreme over the
transient empires of this little world.</p>

<p>After the French Emperor was defeated and taken
prisoner at Sedan a revolution broke out in Paris, and
the terms of peace which had been agreed upon were
refused by the Parisians. So the Germans marched on
Paris, arriving on the 18th of September. By the end of
October 240,000 men began to encircle the ring of fifteen
outer forts which guarded Paris.</p>

<p>Trochu was the Governor of Paris. On the 30th of
September he made a vigorous sortie across the Marne,
to the south-east, where he hoped to join the French army
of the Loire, and also at the same time to relieve Paris
of some hungry mouths.</p>

<p>But the grip of the Germans was too strong. They had
been allowed time to strengthen their positions, and the
sortie failed, though the great guns of the forts had
boomed and crashed until they were glowing hot.</p>

<p>An English ambulance under Mr. Young and Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
Furley was received by the German doctor with great
enthusiasm, for medical comforts were growing scarce in
the field hospital.</p>

<p>The stores were carried into the doctor’s own room,
and as the box of sundries was unpacked it was splendid
to see the delight of the good man.</p>

<p>“Porter,” he cried&mdash;“ganz gut! Ale&mdash;ganz gut!
Chloroform&mdash;ach Gott! Twelve hundred cigars&mdash;du
lieber Gott!” and his hands and eyes went up in delight
and gratitude.</p>

<p>The woollen clothing alone must have saved many
lives. After supper that evening the German doctor got
up and made a little speech.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, some people go about and make large
promises which are never fulfilled. What an example of
the contrary we have now before us! Mr. Young and
Captain Furley heard of our state; they let no red tape
stand in their way, and now this afternoon there comes
jogging up our avenue a waggon bringing what is health&mdash;nay,
what is life&mdash;to our poor sick and wounded. Here
is the Englander all over, gentlemen&mdash;the bulldog that
has no wind to spare in superfluous barking.”</p>

<p>The officers present raised their glasses and shouted
“Hochs!” for the English ambulance. It is pleasant
to hear of such comradeship between men of different
nations.</p>

<p>The next day we are told that, after desperate fighting,
the Head-quarters Staff of the German 12th Army Corps
sat down to a very sombre dinner-table and spoke to
one another in hushed voices, for many chairs were
empty this dinner-time that had been occupied at breakfast.
Not a man in the room but had lost dear friends,
and many had lost kinsmen, and some had brothers
lying out on the snow. On the forenoon of the fourth
day there were found eight poor wretches who had sur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>vived
the inclemency of two nights’ hard frost. Frostbitten,
they lived two days after they were found.</p>

<p>The Germans, after two days’ hard fighting, drove the
French back into Paris, with the loss of 6,000 men; but
they themselves were very disheartened.</p>

<p>Their loss in officers was very large. The 108th Regiment
lost thirty-six officers out of forty-five. In the
knapsacks of the French soldiers were found provisions
for six days, showing that they had hoped to co-operate
with the Southern Army of the Loire.</p>

<p>One day the Prince of Saxe-Weimar went to visit the
wounded Würtembergers, a big man and a kindly heart.
He went round with a box of cigars under his arm, asking
each patient, “Can you smoke?” It was pitiful to see
how they all tried to smoke, though some were too weak
to enjoy their weed. Now the Prince comes upon a
stalwart under officer.</p>

<p>“Are you married?”</p>

<p>“No, Highness; but my mother&mdash;she has three sons
down, all wounded, and it might be bad for her.”</p>

<p>The Prince took out a gold piece.</p>

<p>“Here, my man, send that to the mother, and let her
know it comes from your Queen.”</p>

<p>It seems that the Germans had quite mistaken the
amount of provisions existing in Paris. According to
their calculations by the middle of December Paris ought
to be feeling very hungry, on salt rations at the very best.
They had not yet prepared for a bombardment with
siege guns, hoping that Lady Famine would drive the
Parisians to surrender. But they made no sign.</p>

<p>Down at Argenteuil, on the north-west of Paris, there
was the crackling of the chasse-pot from over the river,
and yet most of the population had come back to their
shops. They gossiped in the streets with French gaiety
and unconcern, while the bullets sang overhead pretty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
freely. The steeple of their beautiful church made a
good observatory, though its sides were riddled with holes
made by shells. The French peasants drove their carts
into the market-place below the church and sold eggs and
butter full merrily; yet somehow, if a German stood at
a window to gaze out, the French sharpshooters would
aim at him. At Lagny there were generally 1,000
prisoners a day passing through to Germany. Some were
so ravenous with hunger that they stooped to pick up
turnip-tops and bones from the gutter, until the British
Society organized a relief with stores of preserved meat
and bread. And there was no hospital for the wounded!
the poor creatures were dumped down in sheds, vans, the
station-rooms, the church, the <i>mairie</i>. In one day there
arrived 1,800 wounded. They were bestowed&mdash;frozen,
hungry, hopeless&mdash;in the cold comfort of the church.
Madame Simon, the lady superintendent of the Saxon
ambulance, did noble things day and night&mdash;a most
devoted woman. There were feats of quiet bravery done
every day. There was a colporteur of the English Bible
Society who used to drive his waggon on a road between
Gonesse and Aulnay, a road exposed to shell-fire more
than most.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, “it is a good time for the men to read
good words when they are standing with the shadow of
death hanging over them.”</p>

<p>There is a story of a boy Lieutenant, von Schramm,
who found himself suddenly in a crowd of Frenchmen.
He leapt from his horse and hid in a house, in the hope
of escaping by the back-door; but his pursuers caught him,
and were taking him towards St. Denis, which lies to the
north of Paris. In going through the park of Le Bourget
the officer who carried von Schramm’s sword was shot and
fell. The boy made a dash for his own sword, grasped the
hilt and cut down the man on his other side, rushed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
the small lake, dived to avoid pursuing bullets, and swam
safely across to rejoin his regiment. The strange thing
was that he had been on the sick-list before his winter
ducking, but now he was blessed with a boy’s appetite.</p>

<p>It spoke well for the German besiegers that they got
on so cordially with the villagers round Paris. These were
mostly of the humbler sort; or servants left behind to
take care of their master’s house. There were lovely
country houses inhabited by a few German officers, and,
were it not for the rents made by shot and shell, the owners
would not have grumbled much at their condition when
they returned to them, though, of course, there were cases
where the boisterous fun of German Lieutenants played
havoc with ormolu and gilding. I remember hearing<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
of a grand piano which gave forth reluctant sounds
when the notes were pressed down. It was discovered
that the strings had been plentifully smeared with jams
and sweetmeats! But these jests were the exception.</p>

<p>The bombardment by the big guns had begun late in
December with much excited wonder on the part of the
Germans. Surely in a few days the Parisians will have
had enough of exploding shells! Now here was almost
the middle of January, and no effect visible. But the
forts round Paris had no living population: no houses
to be burnt, no women and children to mutilate. They
had to be battered to bits, if possible; and Paris was
behaving very heroically now. By the middle of January
she was living very poorly indeed, but she endured yet
another fifteen days longer.</p>

<p>As for the German soldiers, they began now to feel
bored to death, as so often happens in a long siege. The
first excitement evaporates; each day’s unlovely duties
recur with abominable sameness&mdash;and the Germans could
find no beer to drink. A German is used to drink plenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
of beer, and can carry it without ill effects; but when
Fritz took to drinking rum, schnapps, or arrack, he began
to reel about the village streets and look rather disreputable.</p>

<p>It was a strange sight to mount some hill and get a view
of Paris surrounded by its fifteen forts, and in a yet wider
circle by the German lines. The foam of white smoke
surged up all round; the thundering roar of cannon, the
dull echo of distant guns made dismal music to the ear.
The air of Paris is so clear compared to our English cities
that all was quite visible; and now that wood was scarce
and fires few, it was easy to mark the outlines of the larger
buildings, though above them hung a brown pall of smoke,
caused by exploding shells or houses that had caught fire.</p>

<p>Day after day there were rumours of this or that fort
having been silenced. Now it was St. Denis, on the north
side; now Valérien, on the west; now Vincennes, on the
east; but the respite was only given to cool the guns or
renew the emplacements, and all was as it had been.
Besides this there was the daily fear of a new sortie, as
Issy or Ivry broke out into fierce clamour on the south-west
and south-east. Then troops would be hurriedly
transferred along frozen or sometimes muddy roads,
while splinters of shell were whizzing about rather too
familiarly.</p>

<p>It was calculated that on a fierce day of firing the
Germans shot away 10 tons of powder, and nearly
200 tons of heavy matter&mdash;iron and steel&mdash;were hurled
upon the forts and city in twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>There is a story of the Crown Prince of Prussia which
illustrates his kindness of heart. In the 3rd Würtemberg
Dragoons was a certain Jacob, who had an aged and
anxious father. This father had not heard from his son
Jacob for so long a time that the old man, in his rustic
simplicity, sat down and laboriously wrote a letter to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
Crown Prince, asking, “Can Your Highness find out anything
about my son?” The old man knew his son had
fought at Wörth and at Sedan, but nothing later than
Sedan. The Crown Prince did not throw this letter into
the waste-paper basket, but sent it to the officer commanding
the 3rd Würtembergers, requesting that the old
man’s mind should be set at ease. Jacob was sent for
by his commanding officer and asked why he had not
written home.</p>

<p>“Do you know that His Royal Highness the Crown
Prince wants to know why you have not written home
for many weeks?”</p>

<p>The man saluted. His purple face was a study.</p>

<p>“Go and write instantly, and bring the envelope to
me, sirrah.”</p>

<p>How that story got about among the men! How often
has the same experience come to house-masters, when
some loving mother appeals for help: “Please make
Harry write home.” Both Harry and Fritz need a
touch of the spur at times, but how promptly the letter
is written when they feel that touch!</p>

<p>The town of St. Denis suffered terribly. The front of
the theatre was in ruins. The cathedral, being banked
up high with sand-bags, had not suffered so much. The
tombs of the kings had all been thus protected, so had
the statues, and not even a nose had been knocked off.
But the bombardment had shattered many houses and
churches, and the shells had ploughed up the streets, or
rather hoed them into holes. It was only in the cold and
dark cellars that safety could be found. Even there
people were not always safe, and when they were pressed
to take refuge in Paris they peeped forth shuddering, and
swore they would rather die in their own cellars than
sally forth through a tempest of shell-fire.</p>

<p>“At nine o’clock on the evening of the 28th of January,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
1871, while the Head-quarters Staff of the Maes Army
were assembled in the drawing-rooms of the Crown
Prince’s château after dinner, an orderly brought in a
telegram to the Crown Prince. His Royal Highness,
having read it, handed it to General von Schlottheim,
the Chief of the Staff. That officer perused it in his
turn, and then rising, walked to the door communicating
between the billiard-room and the saloon, and there read
the telegram aloud. It was from the Emperor, and it
announced that, two hours before, Count Bismarck and
M. Jules Favre had set their hands to a convention, in
terms of which an armistice to last for twenty-one days
had already come into effect.”</p>

<p>This startling news meant that Paris was ready to surrender.
How many hearts were lighter in both camps
next day! War is not all glory and heroic achievement.
Those who know what war is pray to God that statesmen
and nations may think twice before they rush into so
terrible a calamity. In this war of 180 days the Germans
had won fifteen great victories, captured twenty-six
fortresses, and made 363,000 prisoners.</p>

<p>“Paris is utterly cowed, fairly beaten”&mdash;so they said
who came from Paris to the German lines, and a few non-combatants,
journalists, and philanthropists, ventured
to enter the city before the German troops passed in on
the 1st of March. They found the streets crowded with
men in uniform. The food shops had nothing to sell.
There were a few sickly preserves, nothing solid worth
eating&mdash;some horses’ fat for a delicacy to help down the
stuff they called bread. A fowl was priced at forty-five
francs; stickleback were fourteen francs a pound; butter,
forty francs a pound. Outside the bakers’ shops stood a
shivering line of ladies and women, waiting their turn for
loaves that tasted like putty, and pulled to pieces like
chopped straw.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p>But there were in side streets many of the roughest,
the most cowardly and cruel ruffians of the worst parts
of Paris. They were on the prowl, waiting for their
prey; so no wonder that Mr. Archibald Forbes, journalist,
and several others in divers parts of the city had unpleasant
experiences.</p>

<p>Forbes tells us he was walking down the Champs
Elysées when he met the Crown Prince of Saxony with
his staff riding by. Forbes raised his hat; the Prince returned
the salute and passed on. But the dirty <i>gamins</i>
of Paris had been looking on. They hustled the
Englishman, called him <i>mouchard</i> (spy), <i>sacré Prussien</i>,
<i>cochon</i>, tripped him up, hit him on the back of the head
with a stick; then, when he was down, they jumped on
his stomach with their sabots or wooden shoes. He
struggled, as a Scotsman can, got up, hit out right and
left; but numbers prevailed, and he was dragged by the
legs on his back, with many bumps and bruises, to the
police-station. There he showed his papers, and the
Prefect released him in a humour that said, “I am mighty
glad you Parisians have had a good thrashing.”</p>

<p>Another journalist&mdash;so he told me in London a few weeks
later&mdash;also had ventured to stray away from the German
sentries in order to see what Paris thought of a siege.
He soon found himself the centre of an angry throng.</p>

<p>Some cried: “He is a <i>sacré Prussien</i>! See his yellow
hair!”</p>

<p>“No; I am an English artist,” shouted my friend, still
smiling.</p>

<p>“He is a confounded spy! Take him to the Seine!
duck him in the river!”</p>

<p>They dragged him towards the river-bank. Out of his
eye corners my friend saw several boys pick up stones to
help him to sink. He thought his last hour was come.
They were close to the river: the water looked very cold.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
Then there came to his ears the “tuck” of a drum. A
company of French soldiers was marching by; a Colonel
on horseback rode beside them.</p>

<p>The artist recognized him, for they had once chummed
together near Metz. He called to him by name, and the
Colonel cried “Halt!”</p>

<p>He spurred his horse through the evil-smelling crowd,
and seeing who it was whom the rascals were going to
plunge into the Seine, held up his hand and cried:</p>

<p>“Let that English gentleman go. He is no Prussian,
but an artist who has drawn my portrait&mdash;mine, I tell
you&mdash;for the London journals. He is my friend&mdash;an
English friend, like Mr. Wallace.”</p>

<p>This testimony was enough for them. The excitable
crowd flew to the opposite extreme. Those who had
made ready to stone him like a water-rat now dropped
those stones, and rushing up with remorse and even
affection in their changed looks, threw fusty arms round
his neck, kissed him on both cheeks, sobbed and cried
for forgiveness for their little mistake.</p>

<p>Indeed it is not safe to enter too soon into a conquered
city.</p>

of the wounded&mdash;French numbed by cold&mdash;The lady and

<p>One who was in Paris on the 3rd of September, 1870,
might have heard strange things said in the cafés as
evening came on. The French had suffered a great disaster;
they had surrendered to the Germans at Sedan!
MacMahon was wounded and taken prisoner; the Emperor
had given himself up, and was going to Germany as a
first-class prisoner; 80,000 men captured, and 200 guns.
Was not that news enough to sell every paper in the
street?</p>

<p>Shouts were heard of “Déchéance! Vive la République!”</p>

<p>Where was the poor Empress all this time? “Never
mind her; it was she who had stirred up the Emperor
Napoleon III. to make this horrible war.” So the papers
print cruel caricatures of her. On Sunday, the 4th, very
early in the morning, a huge crowd thronged the Place de
la Concorde; men were pulling down Imperial eagles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
while the mob cheered. The regular soldiers met the
National Guard and made friends.</p>

<p>Men said to one another: “What will become of the
Empress?” “Will she fall a victim to the new patriots?”
And whilst some wondered, a few friends were even then
helping her to escape to England.</p>

<p>Everywhere on walls of houses were bills fixed announcing
the Republic, and inviting all men to rally to the
rescue of “La patrie en danger.”</p>

<p>But the railway-stations were very full of men, women,
and children, who were trying to get a little country air.
Could it be possible that they feared Paris might before
long be besieged?</p>

<p>Drums and bugles incessant, uniforms always, rifles
and side-arms very often. Men stood before the black-draped
statue of Strasbourg, and waved arms wildly,
shouting and screaming, “Revenge!” “Liberty!” and
the like.</p>

<p>By the 10th of the month the Prussian forces, 300,000
strong, were about twenty-five miles from the capital.
People began to look grave, and the more thoughtful
went to the stores, and made secret purchases of coffee,
rice, sugar, and other portable provisions. Still, the
Parisians have not lost their gaiety yet; comic songs and
punchinello evoke hilarious laughter.</p>

<p>Then came the news, “Versailles has honourably capitulated.”</p>

<p>What! so near as that! People are becoming nervous,
so that the new authorities proclaim by billposters that
the fifteen strong forts beyond the line of ramparts
are fully armed and manned by the sailors from the
fleet.</p>

<p>A captive balloon goes up from Montmartre to watch
the enemy. Then it occurs that obstacles outside the
city must be cleared away, so that the chassepot may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
have space to reach the Prussians; and many houses and
bridges go down.</p>

<p>“Well, if there is a siege, have we not got a goodly
store of food&mdash;enough for two months? Are there not
plenty of cattle and sheep, fodder and grain collected
within the walls? Who cares for the Prussians?”</p>

<p>Yet when they see notices posted on the walls instructing
the newly enrolled how to load their muskets,
some have a twinge of doubt and anxiety. A few days
more, and Paris begins to feel she is being encircled by
the enemy. Great movement of troops towards Vincennes.
Official notices now state that all men liable to
military service must report themselves within twenty-four
hours, under penalty of being treated as deserters&mdash;and
shot.</p>

<p>Yet still many are placidly playing dominoes, or
calmly fishing from the bridges in the Seine, quite content
if they catch a gudgeon two inches long.</p>

<p>Yet, if some are betraying levity and selfishness, others
are filled with a desire to do something for their country.
The doctors offer their services in a body, and hospitals
for the wounded are being established at various points.</p>

<p>Ladies wearing a <i>brassard</i> on the arm (the Red Cross
badge) were almost too numerous; and some of these had
more zeal than strength, and failed lamentably when
brought face to face with horrible sights.</p>

<p>On the 19th of September some French forces, who
occupied the heights of Chatillon, were attacked in force
by the Germans, and driven away, and they ran through
Paris crying, “We are betrayed!” but the people gloomily
replied, “Cowards!”</p>

<p>The next day many of these fugitives were marched
along the boulevards, their hands tied behind their backs,
and the word <i>Lâche</i> (coward) printed in large letters between
their shoulders. Yet still crowds of men in uniform<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
and ladies fashionably dressed crowded the cafés, laughing
and full of mirth.</p>

<p>As the bombardment grew, it became the fashion to
gather at the Trocadero, and watch the Prussian shells
exploding in mid-air.</p>

<p>The village folk who had lived within the lines of investment
were brought inside the ramparts, and formed a class
of <i>bouches inutiles</i>, though some of the men were employed
to cut down trees and build barricades.</p>

<p>The Palace of St. Cloud was burnt down about this
time&mdash;some said by the French themselves, either by
accident or design.</p>

<p>A post by balloon and by carrier-pigeons had been introduced&mdash;<i>par
ballon monté</i>&mdash;by which letters were sent
away, but could not be received.</p>

</div>

<p>In the middle of October Colonel Lloyd Lindsay arrived
from England, bringing with him £20,000 as a gift from
England to the sick and wounded. He came into Paris
in the uniform of his rank. This did not prevent his being
captured as a spy, and suffering some indignities at the
hands of the great unwashed of Belleville. Some with
questionable taste said, “The English send us money&mdash;all
right!&mdash;but why do they not help us with men and
guns?”</p>

<p>Trochu, the Governor of Paris, was thought to be rather
infirm of purpose; his sympathies were given more to
Napoleon than to the Republic, and he evidently distrusted
the fighting men within Paris. Indeed, there
were many officers quite unfit for work, who used to lounge
about the cafés, their hands buried in a warm muff and
their noses red with the little glasses they had emptied.
Many battalions of Federals elected their own officers,
and some men were seen to be soliciting votes, bottle in
hand. The National Guard, which was somewhat like
our militia, was distinct from the French army, and con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>tained
many bad characters; they were apt to desert in
time of danger.</p>

<p>On the 21st of October there was a sortie against the
Prussians on the west of Paris. They started at noon,
as Mont Valérien fired three guns in quick succession.
They took with them some new guns, called mitrailleuses,
from which great things were expected. In the evening
there came back a long procession of sixty-four carriages,
all filled with wounded. Crowds of anxious mothers
came clustering round, inquiring for friends. The people
in the street formed two lines for the carriages to pass
between; the men respectfully uncovered their heads.</p>

<p>November came, with snow and bitter frost. Strange
skins of animals began to be worn; fuel was scarce, gas
was forbidden, and epidemics arose. The very poor received
free meals from the <i>mairies</i>, while the more respectable
poor stayed at home, making no sign, but starving in
dumb agony.</p>

<p>On the 30th of November another sortie was attempted.
Some villages were taken by the French, Champigny and
Brie, the mitrailleuses being found very useful in sweeping
the streets; but towards evening the French were repulsed,
and the commander of the 4th Zouaves was left by his
own men on the ground wounded, a shell having dropped
near them. Fortunately, the English ambulance was
close by, and rendered such help as was possible. Then
they drove the helpless officer in a private brougham
back to Paris. What was their indignation when they
found great crowds of people of both sexes indulging in
noisy games, as if it was a holiday! The poor Chef de
Bataillon only lived a few hours after being taken to the
hospital.</p>

<p>Next day ambulances were sent out to search for the
wounded, but they came upon many stragglers bent on
loot. The wounded were in sore plight after spending a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
night on the frozen ground. Some had been able to make
a little fire out of bits of broken wheels, and to roast horse-flesh
cut from horses which the shells had killed. The
French troops had remained in bivouac all that night,
their strength impaired by fatigue and cold; the German
troops, on the contrary, were withdrawn from the field of
battle, their places being taken by others who had not
seen the carnage of the previous day, who were well fed
and sheltered, and thus far better fitted to renew the
fight. No wonder that the poor benumbed French failed
to make a stout resistance. Hundreds of wounded returned
to Paris all the following day, and it became evident that
no effort to break the circle of besiegers could succeed.
Paris awoke at last to the humiliating truth. The day
was cold and foggy; the transport of wounded was the
only sound heard in the streets; in the evening the
streets were dimly lit by oil-lamps, shops all closed at sundown,
and the boom of heavy guns seemed to ring the
knell of doom. All hope was now fixed on the provinces,
but a pigeon-post came in, telling them of a defeat near
Orleans.</p>

<p>“The Army of the Loire has been cut in two! Tant
mieux! (So much the better!) Now we have two Armies
of the Loire.” So the dandy of the pavement dismissed
the disaster with an epigram.</p>

<p>The scarcity of meat was felt in various ways; even the
rich found it difficult to smuggle a joint into their houses,
for it was liable to arrest on its way: some patriots would
take it from a cart or the shoulder of the butcher’s boy,
saying, “Ciel! this aristocrat is going to have more than
his share.” One day a fashionable lady was returning
home carrying a parasol and a neat parcel under her
shawl. After her came six hungry dogs, who could not
be persuaded to go home, though she hissed and scolded
and poked them with her gay parasol. On meeting a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
friend, she first asked him to drive them away, and then
confided to him that she had two pounds of mutton in her
parcel. And so the poor dogs got none!</p>

<p>Amongst the hungry folk we must not forget that there
were nearly 4,000 English in Paris, about 800 of whom
were destitute, and would have starved had it not been for
the kindness of Dr. Herbert and Mr. Wallace. The
wounded were well looked after, for there were 243 ambulances,
of which the largest, the International, had its
headquarters at the Grand Hotel. In one of the Paris
journals it was stated that a lady went to the Mayor’s
house of her district to ask to be given a wounded soldier,
that she might nurse him back to life. They offered her
a Zouave, small and swarthy.</p>

<p>“No, no,” she exclaimed; “I wish for a blonde patient,
being a brunette myself.”</p>

<p>It was hardly worth while going to pay a visit to the
Zoological Gardens, for most of the animals had been
eaten.</p>

<p>Castor and Pollux were amongst the last to render up
their bodies for this service. Castor and Pollux were two
very popular elephants, on whose backs half the boys and
girls in Paris had taken afternoon excursions. Poor
fellows! they were pronounced later on by the critical to
be tough and oily&mdash;to such lengths can human ingratitude
go when mutton is abundant.</p>

<p>They were twins and inseparables in life. Their trunks
were sold for 45 francs a pound, the residue for about
10 francs a pound. Besides the loss of the animals, all
the glass of the conservatories in the Jardin des Plantes
was shattered by the concussion of the big guns, and
many valuable tropical plants were dying.</p>

<p>The citizens, usually so gay and hopeful, presented a
woebegone appearance whenever they saw their soldiers
return from unsuccessful sorties. They began to look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
about for traitors. “Nous sommes trahis!” was their
cry. There was one private of the 119th Battalion who
refused to advance with the others. His Captain remonstrated
with him; the private shot his Captain rather
than face the Germans. A General who was near ordered
the private to be shot at once. A file was drawn up, and
fired on him; he fell, and was left for dead. Presently an
ambulance stretcher came by, and picked him up, as a
wounded man; he was still alive, and had to be dealt with
further by other of his comrades. Let us hope that this
man’s relations never learnt how Jacques came to be so
riddled by bullets.</p>

<p>The houses on the left bank of the Seine were so
damaged that the citizens had to be transferred to the right
bank. In a few days the terrible battery of Meudon opened
fire upon the city. The shells now fell near to the centre
of Paris; day and night without rest or stay the pitiless
hail fell, and this went on for twelve days and nights.
Meanwhile the cold increased and the fuel failed; diseases
spread, and discontent with the Government arose.
Women waiting in the streets for their rations would fall
from exhaustion; others were mangled by shells. The
daily ration for which the poor creatures struggled consisted
now of 10 ounces of bread, 1 ounce of horse-flesh,
and a quarter litre of bad wine.</p>

<p>One more effort the starving Parisians made to break
through on the 19th of January. Early that morning
people were reading the latest proclamation on the walls:
“Citizens, the enemy kills our wives and children, bombards
us night and day, covers with shells our hospitals.
Those who can shed their life’s blood on the field of battle
will march against the enemy&mdash;suffer and die, if necessary,
but conquer!”</p>

<p>Three <i>corps d’armée</i>, more than 100,000 men, were
taking up their positions under cover of Mont Valérien;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
but a dense fog prevailed, and several hours were lost in
wandering aimlessly about, so that the French became
worn out with fatigue, whereas the Germans had passed
a quiet night, with good food to sustain their strength.
Yet for many hours the French obstinately held their
ground; then stragglers began to fall away, and officers
tried in vain to rally their companies. Night fell on a
beaten army hurrying back through the city gates.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the bombardment went on with increasing
violence, until early on the night of the 26th there was
a sudden lull; just before midnight a volley of fire came
from all points of the circle round Paris, then a weird
silence. Then it was known that the terms of surrender
had been signed&mdash;not too soon, for all were at starvation
point, and only six days’ rations remained. Paris had
been very patient under great sufferings through the cold
winter. It is pleasant to remember that supplies of food
sent from England were then waiting admission outside
the northern gates.</p>

<p>An English doctor residing in Paris during the siege
writes thus:</p>

<p>“One lady to whom I carried a fowl was prostrate in
bed, her physical powers reduced by starvation to an
extremely low ebb. When I told her that she was simply
dying from want of food, her reply was that she really
had no appetite; she could not eat anything. Yet when I
gave her some savoury morsel to be taken at once, and
then the fowl to be cooked later on, her face brightened;
she half raised herself in bed, and pressed the little articles
I had brought to her as a child presses a doll. I was told
also that the nurses in an ambulance which I had aided
with the British supplies danced round the tables, and
invoked blessings on our heads. As regards myself, what
I most craved for was fried fat, bacon, and fruit, and,
above all, apples.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides the wild animals of the French Zoological
Gardens, most of the domestic pets had been eaten. A
story is told of one French lady who carefully guarded her
little dog Fido, feeding him from her own plate with great
self-sacrifice. One day the family had the rare treat of a
hot joint, and in the middle of dinner the lady took up a
small bone to carry to Fido in the next room. She
returned in trouble, saying:</p>

<p>“Fido is not in the house; he would so have enjoyed
this bone. I hope he has not got out. They will kill him&mdash;the
brutes!&mdash;and eat him.”</p>

<p>The members of that starving family exchanged uneasy
glances; they were even now engaged upon a salmi,
or hash, formed from a portion of the lady’s pet!</p>

<p class="summary">Metz surrounded&mdash;Taken for a spy&mdash;Work with an ambulance&mdash;Fierce
Prussians rob an old woman&mdash;Attempt to leave Metz&mdash;Refusing
an honour&mdash;The <i>cantinière’s</i> horse&mdash;The grey pet of the regiment&mdash;Deserters
abound&mdash;A village fired for punishment&mdash;Sad scenes
at the end.</p>

<p>One Englishman, the Special Correspondent of the
<i>Manchester Guardian</i>, contrived to enter Metz shortly
before it was besieged. But he had not been there long
before a disagreeable experience befell him. He was
riding quietly outside the city towards the French camps
which were pitched all round it, when suddenly a soldier
stepped across the road, and cried, “Halt!”</p>

<p>Two men seized his reins, asking, “Have you any
papers?”</p>

<p>“Yes; here is my passport,” he replied confidently.</p>

<p>The passport puzzled them; it was taken to a
superior officer, who knew that it was English, but looked
suspiciously at the German visé which it bears.</p>

<p>The Englishman was taken to a General across the road,
who shook his head and remanded him to another
officer of the staff, a mile back towards Metz. It begins
to look serious; this man may be shot as a spy.</p>

<p>Two gendarmes were called up to guard him; soldiers
came up to stare with savage scowls&mdash;he was a spy un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>doubtedly;
but cigarettes were offered by the spy, and
things began to look less cloudy. Then up came General
Bourbaki, and fresh questions were put and answered;
then a mounted messenger was sent to Metz to find out if
the prisoner’s statements were correct. On his return
with a satisfactory account, the prisoner was told to mount
and ride with escort to the head-quarters of the Commander-in-Chief,
Marshal Bazaine. As he rode soldiers
jeered and prophesied a speedy death in a ditch, which
made him feel ill at ease.</p>

<p>A ride of a mile brought him to a pretty château,
where he was received with courtesy and kindness. At
a long common deal table in a wooden pavilion in the
garden sat the Marshal and some twenty officers of the
staff. Dispatches were being written, signed, and sent
off by mounted messengers. In the corner was an electric
telegraph, ticking off reports from distant points.</p>

<p>When the conference broke up, Marshal Bazaine
motioned the suspect to a seat, and questioned him, made
him show on a map where he had been riding, found he
understood no German and was a fool at maps (perhaps a
little stupidity was put on), then he left him to his secretary.</p>

<p>The latter said, with a sly glance: “We have so many
spies that we are bound to be careful, but the arrest in
this case is a stupid thing (<i>une bêtise</i>). I will give you a
<i>laissez-passer</i> for the day, monsieur.”</p>

<p>So he went off, relieved at not being shot for a spy, but
somewhat mortified.</p>

<p>There was hard fighting going on in the country round
Metz. Our countryman managed to get attached to an
ambulance, and went on to a battle-field at night.</p>

<p>“We lit our lanterns,” he says, “and went cautiously
into the valley. There were Prussian sharpshooters in
the wood beyond, and I confess I was very nervous at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
first: the still night, the errand we were on, all awed one.
But so soon as we reached the outskirts of the battle-field
all personal feelings gave way to others. Here at
every turn we found our aid was wanted. Thousands of
dead and wounded were around us, and we, a few strangers
sent by the International Society of London, were all that
were present to help them. Plugging and bandaging
such wounds as were hopeful of cure, giving a life-saving
drink here and there, moving a broken limb into a more
easy position, and speaking a word of encouragement
where the heart was failing&mdash;this was all we could do.
But all that night each worked his utmost, and when our
water failed two of us walked back four miles to Gravelotte
and brought a bucketful. We can dress, but not
remove, the wounded now. Often have I been tempted to
put a poor fellow out of his pain; it seems kinder, wiser,
and more Christian to blow out the flickering lamp than
let it smoulder away in hours of anguish. Daylight begins
to dawn, and we seek carriages&mdash;that is, jolting unhung
carts&mdash;to convey some of the wounded. Now, as we raise
them up and torture their poor wounds by moving them,
for the first time we hear a cry. The groans of the dying,
the shrieks of the wounded, are absent from the battle-field,
but far more dreadful and awe-inspiring is the awful
stillness of that battle-field at night. There is a low,
quivering moan floats over it&mdash;nothing more; it is a
sound almost too deep for utterance, and it thrills through
one with a strange horror. Hardly a word is uttered,
save only a half-wailed-out cry of ‘Ohé! ma pauvre
mère!’ Nothing is more touching, nothing fills one’s
eyes with tears more, than this plaintive refrain chanted
out as a death-chant by so many sons who never more on
this side the grave will see again that longed-for mother&mdash;‘Ohé!
ma mère, ma pauvre mère!’</p>

<p>“We select sixty or seventy of those whose wounds will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
bear removal, and turn our faces towards Metz. Slowly
and sadly we creep out of the death-valley. The quaint
hooded forms of the sentinels who challenge us cut out
strangely against the green and gold of the morning sky.
Not a walking-stick, not a pipe is left us: they were cut
up into tourniquet-keys. I am ashamed to say I regretted
my pipe; but it came back to me after many weeks, being
brought to me by the man whose life it had saved. Very
grateful he was. As we toil upwards, musing on life and
death, bang! right in our very faces spits out a cannon.
Good heavens! they surely are not going to begin this
devil’s work again! Yes; there goes a battery to the
crest of the hill. We must take care of ourselves and
those we have so far rescued from slaughter. On we
tramp, but there is no food, not a crust of bread, not a
drop of water for our wounded. It is nine miles more
back to Metz, and tired as we are, we must walk it. Very
tired and hungry and cross we enter Metz, and there see
the French ambulances waiting with waggon-loads of appliances
and well-groomed horses. They had stopped to
breakfast, and many hundreds have died because they
did so. Well, we have earned ours, at any rate.”</p>

<p>It was now the 28th of August. Metz was blockaded. No
letters could be sent, for the German hosts were holding
the heights all round. Ruthless rough-riders were riding
into every French village. In one of these, the story
goes, a poor old woman was washing her little store of
linen. She was very old, and her grey hair sprouted in
silver tufts from her yellow skin. All the rest had fled
in panic; she alone was left busy at her tub, when up
rode some score of huge Dragoons. They pulled up in
front of her, speaking their barbarous tongue. One
Dragoon dismounts and draws his sword. Poor old
woman! she falls upon her knees and lifts up wrinkled
hands and cries feebly for mercy. It is in vain! Neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
age nor ugliness protects her. Raising his sword with one
hand, he stretches out the other towards her&mdash;the Prussian
monster!&mdash;and grasps her soap. He quietly cuts it in
two, pockets the one half and replaces the other on the
well wall, growling out, “Madame, pardon!”</p>

<p>The reaction was too great. When they rode away
laughing, the old woman forgot to be thankful that they
had not hurt her, and swore at them for hairy thieves.</p>

<p>On the 15th of September there were around Metz
138,000 men fit to take the field, 6,000 cavalry and
artillery. The Prussians had not anything like that
number. They were dying fast of dysentery and fever,
and yet Bazaine did nothing. Yet, though Metz was not
strongly held, it was very difficult to get through the
lines, and many a man, tempted by the bribe of 1,000
francs, lost his life in the attempt.</p>

<p>The English journalist tried to be his own courier and
carry his own letters. He presented himself at the
Prussian outposts in daylight, showed his passport, and
demanded permission to “pass freely without let or
hindrance.” In vain. The German soldiers treated him
to beer and cigars, and suggested he should return to
Metz. Next time he dressed himself up as a peasant,
with blouse, and sabots on his feet, and when it was
growing dusk tried to slip through the posts. “Halte
là!” rang out, and a sound of a rifle’s click brought him
up sharp. He was a prisoner, taken to the guard-house,
and questioned severely. He pretended to be very weak-headed,
almost an idiot.</p>

<p>“How many soldiers be there in Metz, master? I
dunno. Maybe 300. There’s a power of men walking
about the streets, sir.”</p>

<p>They smiled a superior smile, and offered the poor idiot
some dark rye-bread, cheese, and beer, and some clean
straw to lie down upon. Officers came to stare at him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
asked him what village he was bound for. One of them
knew the village he named, and recognized his description
of it, for luckily he had got up this local knowledge
from a native in Metz. However, he was not permitted
to go to it, for before dawn next morning they led him,
shuffling in his wooden sabots, to a distant outpost, turned
his face towards Metz, with the curt remark: “Go
straight on to Metz, friend, or you will feel a bullet go
through your back.”</p>

<p>Grumbling to himself, he drew near the French outposts,
who fired at him. He lay down for some time,
then, finding he was in a potato-field, he set to work and
grubbed up a few potatoes to sell for a sou a piece. So
at last he found his way back to Metz, and got well
laughed at for his pains.</p>

<p>He then tried his hand at making small balloons to
carry his letters away; but the Germans used to fire at
them, wing them, and read the contents.</p>

<p>Many spies were shot in Metz, and some who were not
spies, but only suspected. It was the only excitement
in the city to go out to the fosse and see a spy shot.</p>

<p>There was one man whom all raised their hats to salute
when he passed. He was a short, thick-set man, wore a
light canvas jacket and leather gaiters. Under one arm
hung a large game-bag, and over the other sloped a
chassepot rifle. His name was Hitter, and he had made
a great name by going out in front of the <i>avant-poste</i>
and shooting the Prussian sentinels. One night he encountered
some waggons, shot down the escort from his
hiding-place, and brought four waggons full of corn into
Metz, riding on the box by the driver, pistol in hand.
This man organized a body of sharp-shooters for night
work, and many a poor sentinel met his death at their
hands.</p>

<p>One favourite dodge was to take out with them a tin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
can fastened to a long string. When they got near the
Prussian outposts they made this go tingle tangle along
the ground. Then cautious heads would peep out; more
tangle tingle from the tin can, until the sentinels jump
up and blaze away at the weird thing that startles them
in the dark. Their fire has been drawn, and Hitter’s
men have the outpost at their mercy. They either shoot
them or bring them into Metz as prisoners.</p>

<p>At length Marshal Bazaine heard of Hitter’s prowess,
and sent for him, wanting to decorate him; but Hitter
was sensitive, and thought he ought to have been decorated
weeks ago. He came reluctantly.</p>

<p>“My man, I have heard of your doings&mdash;your clever
work at night&mdash;and in the name of France I give you
this decoration to wear.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want it, Marshal. Pray excuse me, if you
please.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, my fine fellow. I insist on your acceptance
of the honour.”</p>

<p>“Oh! very well,” said Hitter, “if you insist, I suppose
I must; but, by your leave, I shall wear it on my
back&mdash;and very low down, too.”</p>

<p>The Marshal glared at Hitter, turned red, and ordered
him out.</p>

<p>As the siege went on the poor horses got thinner and
thinner. Their coats stood out in the wet weather rough
and bristly; often they staggered and fell dead in the
streets. They were soon set upon, and in a short time
flesh, bones, and hide had vanished, and only a little pool
of blood remained behind to tell where some hungry
citizens had snatched a good dinner.</p>

<p>One day a <i>cantinière</i> had left her cart full of drinkables
just outside the gate while she went to the fort to ask
what was wanted. She tarried, and her poor horse felt
faint, knelt down, and tried to die. No sooner was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
poor beast on his knees than half a score of soldiers rushed
out to save his life by cutting his throat&mdash;at least, it
made him eat better. They quickly slipped off his skin
and cut him up in all haste. So many knives were “e’en
at him,” they soon carried off his “meat.” Then, in a
merry mood, seeing the gay <i>cantinière</i> was too busy
flirting to attend to her cart, they carefully set to work
and built him up again. They put the bones together
neatly, dragged the hide over the carcass, and arranged
the harness to look as if the animal had lain down between
the shafts. Then they retired to watch the comedy that
sprang out of a tragedy. Madame comes bustling out of
the fort. Eh! what’s that? Poor Adolfe is down on
the ground! The fat woman waddles faster to him, calls
him by name, taunts him with want of pluck, scolds, gets
out her whip; then is dumb for some seconds, touches
him, cries, weeps, wrings her hands in despair. Sounds
of laughter come to her ears; then she rises majestically
to the occasion, pours out a volley of oaths&mdash;oaths of
many syllables, oaths that tax a genius in arithmetic:
<i>diable! cent diables, mille diables, cent mille diables!</i> and
so on, until she loses her breath, puts her fat hand to her
heart, and again falls into a pathetic mood, passing later
on into hysteria, and being led away between two gendarmes.
Poor madame! She had loved Adolfe, and
would have eaten him in her own home circle rather than
that those <i>sacrés</i> soldiers should filch him away.</p>

<p>Well, they ate horses, when they could get them; but
donkeys were even more delicious, though very rare, for
they seldom died, and refused to get fat. Food was
growing so scarce in October that when you went out to
dinner you were expected to take your own bread with
you. Potatoes were sold at fifteen pence a pound; a
scraggy fowl might be bought for thirty shillings. The
Prussians had spread nets across the river, above and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
below, to prevent the French from catching too many
fish. As for sugar, it rose to seven shillings a pound.
Salt was almost beyond price. The poor horses looked
most woebegone. Many of them were Arabs, their bones
nearly through their skin, and they looked at their friends
with such a pitiful, appealing eye that it was most touching.
You might have gone into a trooper’s tent and wondered
to see the big tear rolling slowly down the bronzed cheek
of a brave soldier.</p>

<p>“What is it, m’sieur? I have just lost my best friend&mdash;my
best friend. He was with me in Algeria. Never
tumbled, never went lame. And he understood me better
than any Christian. He would have done anything for
me&mdash;in reason! Now he has had to go to the slaughter-house.
Oh, it is cruel, m’sieur! I shall never be the
same man again, for he loved me and understood me&mdash;and
I loved him.”</p>

<p>At last there was only one horse left in that camp, and
this was how he survived: He had laid himself down to
die; his eyes were fogging over, he felt so weak; but one
of the sick soldiers happened to pass that way, and being
full of pity from his own recent sufferings, he bethought
him of a disused mattress which he had seen in the
hospital close by. He returned and took out a handful
of straws, with which he fed the poor beast, a straw at
a time. The flaccid lips mumbled them awhile. At last
he managed to moisten the straw and eat a little. Another
handful was fetched, and the horse pricked his ears, and
tried to lift his head. That was the turning-point; life
became almost worth living again. The story rapidly
spread, and it became the charitable custom to spare a
bit of bread from dinner for the white horse of the Ile
Cambière. In time that spoilt child would neigh and
trot to meet any trooper who approached, confidently
looking for his perquisite of crust.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p>There were 20,000 horses in Metz at the beginning of
the siege; at the time of the surrender a little over 2,000.</p>

<p>We are told by an Englishman who was with the
German Army outside Metz that in October a good many
Frenchmen deserted from Metz. On the 11th a poor
wretch was brought into the German lines. He said
that his desertion was a matter of arrangement with his
comrades. The man was an Alsatian, and spoke German
well. His regiment was supposed to be living under
canvas, but the stench in the tents was so strong, by
reason of skin diseases, that nearly all slept in the open
air. The skin disease was caused by the want of vegetables
and salt, and by living wholly on horse-flesh. The
deserter reported that the troops had refused to make
any more sorties, and they were all suffering from scurvy.</p>

<p>There was one village, Nouilly, which contained secret
stores, to which the French used to resort, and which the
Germans could not find; so the order was given to burn
it. Most of its inhabitants had gone to live in Metz.</p>

<p>“I was sitting at supper with Lieutenant von Hosius
and Fischer when an orderly entered with a note. It
was read aloud:</p>

<p>“‘Lieutenant von Hosius will parade at nine o’clock
with fifteen volunteers of his company, and will proceed
to burn the village of Nouilly.’</p>

<p>“Von Hosius was fond of herrings, so he stayed at table
to finish them, while Fischer went out for volunteers.
In a few minutes von Hosius was putting on his long
boots, taking his little dagger, which every officer wore
to ward off the vultures of the battle-field in case of being
wounded; then, taking his revolver, he sallied out to meet
his little band. The service was full of danger, for the
French lay very near, and had strong temptations for
entering it by night. If he did encounter a French force
inside the village, where would his fifteen volunteers be?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<p>“A little group of us watched by the watch-fire as they
marched down at the German quick step. For a while
we could hear the crashing through the vines, then the
hoarse challenge of the German rear sentry; then all
became quiet. For a few minutes the officer in command
of the outpost and myself were the only persons who
enjoyed the genial warmth of the fire; then through the
gloom came stalking the Major, who squatted down
silently by our side. Presently another form appeared&mdash;the
Colonel himself&mdash;and in half an hour nearly all the
officers of the battalion were round that bright wood fire.
They all tried to look unconcerned, but everybody was
very fidgety.</p>

<p>“Von Hosius was a long time. An hour had gone, and
Nouilly was but ten minutes or so distant, and the
Colonel’s nervousness was undisguised as he hacked at
the burning log with his naked sword. Suddenly the
vigilant Lieutenant gave a smothered shout, and we all
sprang to our feet. Flame-coloured smoke at last, and
plenty of it. But, bah! it was too far away&mdash;a false
alarm.</p>

<p>“The Colonel sat down moodily, and the Major muttered
something like a swear. One thing was good: there was
no sound of musketry firing.</p>

<p>“Another half-hour of suspense, and then a loud “Ha!”
from both Lieutenant and sentry. This time it was
Nouilly, and no mistake. Not from one isolated house,
but in six places at once, belched out the long streaks of
flame against the black darkness, and the separate fires
made haste to connect themselves. In ten minutes the
whole place was in one grand blaze, the church steeple
standing up in the midst of the sea of flame until a firework
of sparks burst from its top and it reeled to its
fall.</p>

<p>“Presently they came back, von Hosius panting with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
the exertion (he was of a portly figure). The duty had
been done without firing a single shot, and they brought
with them a respectable old horse which they had found
in a village stable.”</p>

<p>One evening, when the German officers were discussing
the causes of the French defeats, a First Lieutenant told
this story to illustrate it:</p>

<p>The Chief Rabbi of the Dantzic Jews had taken a new
house, and his flock determined to stock his wine-butt
for him. On a stated evening his friends went down one
after another into the Rabbi’s cellar, and emptied each
his bottle into the big vat. When the Rabbi came next
day to draw off his dinner wine he found the cask was
full of pure water. Each Jew had said to himself that
one bottle of water could never be noticed in so great a
quantity of wine, and so the poor Rabbi had not got a
drop of wine in his butt.</p>

<p>Now, it was just the same with the French army. One
soldier said to himself that it would not matter a copper
if he sneaked away; but the bother was that one and all
took the same line of reasoning, and the result was that
nobody was left to look the enemy in the face.</p>

<p>In order to bring about the fall of Metz a little sooner,
the Prussians drove out all the peasants from the neighbouring
villages, and forced them down to Metz. The
Mayor of Metz ordered them back; then the Prussians
fired over their heads, and tried to frighten them down
again. Meanwhile, the women and children were worn
out and hungry, and sat down to cry and wish for death.
These are some of the glories of war. Sometimes, when
they returned to their village home after a week’s absence,
they found a remarkable change. They had left a pretty
villa, trim gardens, and tiny pond and summer-house.
This is what an Englishman saw one day:</p>

<p>“I came on a little group, the extreme pathos of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
made my heart swell. It was a family, and they sat in
front of what had once been their home. That home was
now roofless. The stones of the walls were all that was
left. The garden was a wreck, and the whole scene was
concentrated desolation. The husband leaned against
the wall, his arms folded, his head on his chest. The
wife sat on the wet ground, weeping over the babe at her
breast. Two elder children stared around them with
wonder and unconcern&mdash;too young to realize their misfortune.
No home, no food, a waggon and a field with
four graves in it&mdash;a sight enough to melt the hardest
heart.”</p>

<p>But there were so many similar scenes, and some much
more terrible to witness.</p>

<p>On the 29th of October, in torrents of rain, the French
soldiers went out of Metz, casting down their rifles and
swords in heaps at the gate, many glad enough to become
prisoners of war and have a full stomach. The Germans
came in very cautiously, examining fort and bastion and
bridge, to prevent any mine explosions, and in a few
hours “Metz la Pucelle” had become a German city.
Marshal Bazaine, who had done so little to help them,
was the object of every citizen’s curses. The women
pelted him with mud and called him “Coward!” as he
set off for the Prussian headquarters.</p>

<span class="smaller">PLEVNA (1877)</span></h2>

<p class="summary">An English boy as Turkish Lieutenant&mdash;A mêlée&mdash;Wounded by a
horseman&mdash;Takes letter to Russian camp&mdash;The Czar watches the
guns&mdash;Skobeleff’s charge&mdash;The great Todleben arrives&mdash;Skobeleff

<p>After Turkey had put down the insurrection in Bulgaria
(1876) and had beaten Servia (October, 1876), Russia
made her tenth attempt to seize Constantinople. The
Czar, Alexander II., declared war against the Sultan,
Abdul Hamid II., and the result was a war which in
cruelty and horrors has had no equal since the first
Napoleon retired to St. Helena.</p>

<p>There were a few young Englishmen fighting on the
side of the Turks, one of whom, Lieutenant Herbert, has
left us a full account of the siege of Plevna. He says in
his preface:</p>

<p>“I have witnessed much that was heroic, much that
was grand, soul-stirring, sublime, but infinitely more of
what was hideous and terrible. If you have too firm a
belief in the glories of soldiering, try a war.”</p>

<p>Herbert was soon made Mulazim, or Lieutenant, and
his friend Jack Seymour was in the same company. The
first successes of the Russians were checked when Osman
Pasha stood at bay at Plevna, and the Turks literally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
dug themselves into the hills around the city, while the
Russians lost thousands of men in vain assaults upon the
earthworks.</p>

<p>It was in the second battle of Plevna that a Bimbashi,
or Major, came up to Herbert and said:</p>

<p>“The General has sent for reinforcements. Take your
company; an orderly will show the way. Do your best,
Mulazim. You are but a boy, in a position which might
unnerve a man twice your age. Rise to the occasion, as
Englishmen are wont to do. The soldiers love you. You
and your compatriot have but to lead, and they will
follow. Remember the Czar Nicholas’ furious cry in the
Crimean War: ‘We have been beaten by a handful of
savages led by British boys!’”</p>

<p>As they climbed to a distant hill they suddenly overlooked
a battle-field of twenty square miles in area&mdash;terrible
to see, terrible to hear. The thunder of 240 guns
seemed like the crash of so many volcanoes; the earth
trembled like a living thing. It was like standing in the
centre of a raging fire. Presently the Russian troops drew
near. The Turks began a quick fire of three minutes’
duration. Deep gaps showed in their lines, but they
were soon filled up, and still they drew nearer. The
Russian “Hurrah!” and the wild Turkish cry of “Allah!”
mingled together. Now there were only 100 paces
between the charging lines, the Russians coming up hill,
the Turks rushing down. Then came a chaos of stabbing,
clubbing, hacking, shouting, cursing men: knots of two
or three on the ground, clinging to each other in a deadlier
Rugby football; butt-ends of rifles rising and falling like
the cranks of many engines; horses charging into solid
bodies of men; frantic faces streaming with blood. All
the mad-houses of the world might be discharging their
contents into this seething caldron of human passion.</p>

<p>“I remember nothing; all I know is that I discharged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
the six chambers of my revolver, but at whom I have no
notion; that my sabre was stained with blood, but with
whose I cannot tell; that suddenly we looked at one
another in blank surprise, for the Russians had gone,
save those left on the ground, and we were among friends,
all frantic, breathless, perspiring, many bleeding, the
lines broken, all of us jabbering, laughing, dancing about
like maniacs. Fifteen minutes after the first charge the
Russians returned. Of this charge I remember one item
too well. A giant on a big horse&mdash;a Colonel, I think&mdash;galloped
up to me and dealt me a terrific blow from above.
I parried as well as I could, but his sword cut across my
upturned face, across nose and chin, where the mark is
visible to this day. I felt the hot blood trickle down my
throat. He passed on. Sergeant Bakal, my friend and
counsellor, spoke to me, pointing to my face. Jack said
something in a compassionate voice. I fainted. When
I came to myself, my head had been bandaged, the nose
plastered all over. Water was given me. How grateful I
was for that delicious drink! Then I was supported by
friends to the outskirts of Plevna. As we went along I
noticed a Russian Lieutenant who, after creeping along
for a space, had sat down by the side of the track, leaning
against the belly of a dead horse. He was calmly awaiting
death in awful forsakenness. He counted barely
twenty summers, poor boy! He looked at me, oh! so
wistfully and sadly, with the sweet, divine light of
deliverance shining in his tearful eyes. He said faintly:
‘De l’eau, monsieur?’</p>

<p>“I had some cold coffee left in my flask, which I got
my companion to pour down his throat. He bowed his
poor bruised head gratefully, and we left him to die.
The ground was strewn with haversacks, rifles, swords,
wounded men; riderless horses, neighing vehemently,
trotted about in search of food. These sights were revealed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
to me by the peaceful, dying golden light of a summer
sunset. Even war, that hell-born product of the iniquity
of monarchs and statesmen, receives its quota of sunshine.”</p>

<p>A few weeks later Herbert was summoned to the Ferik,
or General of Division, and asked if he could speak French
well enough to take a letter into the Russian camp. He
said “Yes,” made himself smart in new tunic and boots,
and flattered himself that his tanned, smooth, youthful
face looked well below the bright red fez with its jaunty
tassel, in spite of his chin being still under repair. A
corporal carrying a white flag and a bugler well mounted
rode with him. They were handsome, strapping fellows,
in the highest of spirits. After a ride of six miles they
came in sight of a detachment of Cossacks. A young
Russian Lieutenant rode to meet them, waving his handkerchief.
Herbert stated his business in French, was
asked to dismount while awaiting instructions. The
Russians crowded round out of curiosity; the horses were
fed and watered, cigarettes were exchanged, and friendly
talk ensued. In half an hour a horseman rode up, and
Herbert was bidden to mount. His eyes were bandaged,
his horse was led. After a sharp trot of twenty minutes
they halted, the handkerchief was taken off, and he found
himself in a battery. An officer came up and took the
letter, then handed Herbert over to an infantry Colonel,
who took him into a small tent. Here, with some other
officers, they had a cosy meal&mdash;wine, bread, and soup&mdash;a
pleasant chat and smiles all round. It was a fortnight
since the last battle, and the Russians were still lost in
admiration of the bravery with which the Turks had
defended their positions.</p>

<p>“Vos hommes, mon camarade, sont des diables.
Jamais je n’ai vu pareille chose.”</p>

<p>That was just a glimpse of the enemy, and proved that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
though men may fight by order, they may yet be friends
at heart.</p>

<p>The Czar Alexander had been present, watching the
varied issues of every fight and assault. The sappers had
built for him a kind of outlook on a little hill beyond the
line of fire, where he could see far away on all sides. A
large tent was standing behind, supplied with food and
wine, where his suite made merry; but the poor, worn,
anxious Czar could not eat, could not bide in his safe
tower, but would go wandering round among the gunners
and the guns. It was his fête-day when the great September
battle was being fought. There he stood alone
on his little balcony, under the lowering sky of an autumn
day, gazing through his glass at the efforts of his soldiers
to storm the Gravitza redoubt. All the afternoon assault
had followed assault in vain, and now the last desperate
effort, the forlorn hope, was being pushed to the front.
The pale, drawn face on the balcony was now quivering
with agonized sorrow; the tall figure was bent and bowed,
and seemed to wince under the lash of some destroying
angel. With awful losses the Russian battalions staggered
and struggled up the slopes slippery with their
comrades’ blood.</p>

<p>“See, sire, they have entered the redoubt; it is carried
at last!”</p>

<p>Hardly has the Czar time to smile and breathe a prayer
of gratitude when from a second redoubt higher up a
terrible fire is turned on the Russians, and they are swept
out of the place they had so hardly won.</p>

<p>There was one Russian officer who seemed to have a
charmed life. He was the bravest of the brave, was
beloved by his men, and did marvels of heroic feats&mdash;Skobeleff.
On a day of battle Skobeleff always wore a
white frock-coat, with all his decorations. Seeing the
battalions coming back from the Gravitza in disorderly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
route, the tall white figure on the white horse dashed at
full speed down the slope, passed the linesmen, who gave
their loved chief a great cheer as he galloped by, caught
up the riflemen who were advancing in support, and
swept them on at the double. Men sprang to their feet
and rapturously cheered the white-clad leader. He
reached the wavering beaten mass, pointed upwards with
his sword, and imparted to daunted hearts some of his
own courage and enthusiasm. They turned with him
and tried yet once more. Then the white horse went
down. The glass trembled in the hands of Alexander.</p>

<p>“He is down!”</p>

<p>“No, sire; he rises&mdash;he mounts again! See, they are
over and into the Turkish entrenchments!”</p>

<p>What a medley of sights and sounds&mdash;flame and smoke
and shouts and screams! But the Russians were for the
present masters of the redoubt.</p>

<p>In the evening Skobeleff rode back without a scratch
on him, though his white coat was covered with blood
and froth and mud. His horse&mdash;his last white charger&mdash;was
shot dead on the edge of the ditch; his blade was
broken off short by the hilt. Every man of his staff was
killed or wounded, except Kuropatkin.</p>

<p>“General Skobeleff,” wrote MacGahan to the <i>Daily
News</i>, “was in a fearful state of excitement and fury.
His cross of St. George twisted over his shoulder, his face
black with powder and smoke, his eyes haggard and
bloodshot, his voice quite gone. I never saw such a
picture of battle as he presented.”</p>

<p>But a few hours later the General was calm and collected.
He said in a low, quiet voice:</p>

<p>“I have done my best; I could do no more. My detachment
is half destroyed; my regiments no longer exist;
I have no officers left. They sent me no reinforcements.
I have lost three guns!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why did they send you no help? Who was to
blame?”</p>

<p>“I blame nobody,” said Skobeleff; then solemnly
crossing himself, he added: “It was the will of God&mdash;the
will of God!”</p>

<p>Skobeleff’s heroism was magnificent, and did much to
nerve the common soldier to face the Turkish batteries;
but success came not that way. Men and officers began
to ask one another why the Czar did not send them the
help of the great Todleben, who had defended Sebastopol
so brilliantly. It seems that the Grand Duke Nicholas
had nourished a grudge against Russia’s most eminent
engineer, and had kept him out of all honourable employment.
But Alexander had sent for Todleben, and this
was the turn of the tide. Todleben came in such haste
from Russia that he had brought no horses with him.
Now he was at last in the Russian camp&mdash;a handsome,
tall, dignified man of sixty, straight and active, and very
affable to all. The attack was to be changed. No more
deadly assaults in front, but a complete investment, and
wait till famine steps in to make Osman submit.</p>

<p>But Skobeleff had not yet finished with daring assaults.
One day the “Green Hill,” which the Russians had taken
under his command, was being endangered by Turkish
sharp-shooters. Russian recruits who were posted near
had fallen back in a scare, thrown down their rifles, and
simply run like hares. Skobeleff met them in full flight,
and in grim humour shouted: “Good health, my fine
fellows&mdash;my fine, brave fellows!”</p>

<p>The men halted and gave the customary salute, being
very shamefaced withal.</p>

<p>“You are all noble fellows; perfect heroes you are. I
am proud to command you!”</p>

<p>Silent and confounded, they shambled from one leg to
another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<p>“By the way,” said Skobeleff, still blandly smiling,
“I do not see your rifles!”</p>

<p>The men cast their eyes down and said not a word.</p>

<p>“Where are your rifles, I ask you?” in a sterner tone.</p>

<p>There was a painful silence, which Skobeleff broke with
a voice of thunder. His face changed to an awful frown,
his glance made the men cower.</p>

<p>“So you have thrown away your weapons! You are
cowards! You run away from Turks! You are a disgrace
to your country! My God! Right about face!
My children, follow me!”</p>

<p>The General marched them up to the spot where they
had left their rifles, and ordered them to take them up
and follow him. Then he led them out into the space in
front of the trench, right in the line of the Turkish fire,
and there he put them through their exercises, standing
with his back to the Turks, while the bullets could be
heard whistling over and around them. Only two of
them were hit during this strange drill. Then he let
them go back to their trenches, saying: “The next time
any one of you runs away, he will be shot!”</p>

<p>The investment of Plevna went on relentlessly through
October, November, and part of December. By the 9th
almost all their food was exhausted, and Osman determined
to try one last sortie before surrendering. Herbert
had charge of a train of a battalion outside the town. He
made up a fire, saw his men installed for the night, and
then walked to the town. A snowfall was coming down
lazily; bivouac fires lit up the gaunt figures of men and
beasts. The men, talking of to-morrow’s fight in a subdued
tone, were yet excited and eager. Many Turkish
residents, with their carts and vehicles, were spending the
night on the snow-covered plain, the men brooding and
gloomy, the veiled women sobbing, the children playing
hide-and-seek around the fires and among the carts. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
was a weird sight&mdash;all these thousands eager to go out
after the army when the last struggle should have
carved them an open road through the surrounding
foe.</p>

<p>At head-quarters an officer met Herbert, and asked him
to post some labels at the ambulance doors of a certain
street. He says:</p>

<p>“Armed with a brush and paste-pot, I turned bill-sticker,
and affixed a notice on some twenty house doors
which were showing the ambulance flag. Anything more
dismal than that deserted town, abandoned by all but
dying and helpless men and some 400 starving Bulgarian
families, cannot be imagined. Desolate, dead, God-forsaken
Plevna during the night of the 9th and 10th of
December was no more like the thriving and pretty Plevna
of July than the decaying corpse of an old hag is like the
living body of a blooming girl. The streets, unlighted and
empty, save for a slouching outcast here and there bent
on rapine, echoed to the metallic ring of my solitary steps;
while occasional groans or curses proceeding from the
interior of the ambulances haunted me long afterwards
as sounding unearthly in the dark. Twice I stumbled
over corpses which had been thrust into the gutter as the
quickest way of getting rid of them.</p>

<p>“As I walked I had to shake myself and pinch my flesh,
so much like the phantasy of an ugly dream was the
scene to my mind. As I plied my brush on the door-panels,
I felt like one alive in a gigantic graveyard.</p>

<p>“At one of the ambulances I was bidden to enter, and
found, by the feeble light of a reeking oil-lamp, some
invalids fighting for a remnant of half-rotten food
which they had just discovered in a forgotten cupboard.
Men without legs, hands, or feet were clutching, scratching,
kicking, struggling for morsels that no respectable
dog or cat would look at twice. I pacified them, and dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>tributed
the unsavoury bits of meat. As I turned to go
a man without legs caught hold of me from his mattress,
begging me to carry him to the train bivouac, that he
might follow the army. Happily an attendant turned up,
and I wrenched myself away.”</p>

<p>Herbert was returning by a narrow dark lane when
someone sprang upon him and tore the paste-pot away
from him. He had doubtless seen it by the light of the
Lieutenant’s lantern, and thought the vessel contained
food.</p>

<p>He belaboured the fellow’s face with his brush, making
it ghastly white, and setting him off to splutter and croak
and swear, and finally he rammed the bristles hard down
his throat. At this moment two other Bulgarians came
up; but, taking time by the forelock, Herbert pasted
their mouths and eyes before they could speak, then
shouted out, “Good-night, gentlemen, and I wish you a
very hearty appetite.” He then turned and ran for all
he was worth to the officers’ mess-room. It was about
ten o’clock p.m. when Osman Pasha and his staff rode up,
preceded by a mounted torch-bearer, and escorted by
a body of Saloniki cavalry.</p>

<p>When he came out again, the light from the torch fell
full upon his face. His features were drawn and care-worn,
the cheeks hollow; there were deep lines on the
forehead, and blue rings under his eyes. Their expression
was one of angry determination. He responded to the
salute with that peculiar nod which was more a frown
than a greeting. They all rose and went after him into
the street to see him mount his fine Arab horse. He and
his staff spent that last night in one of the farm-houses
on the western outskirts of Plevna.</p>

<p>After a supper of gruel and bread, Herbert and the others
walked in a body to the train bivouac. The night was
intensely dark; a few snowflakes were flying about; it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
was freezing a little. They did not talk, for each was
saying to himself, “It is all over with us now.” Hardly
any expected to see the next nightfall.</p>

<p>Herbert and two other Lieutenants slept in a hut by the
river’s brink; they could hear the water murmuring, and
every now and then a lump of ice made music against
the piles. A little after five in the morning he moved on,
crossed with the first division the shaky pontoon bridge,
and rejoined his company. Twenty-four crack battalions
of the First Division were marching on to face the ring of
Russian guns; the dark hoods of the great-coats drawn
over the fez and pointing upwards gave an element of
grotesqueness to the men. They were marching to certain
death, with hope in their hearts.</p>

<p>In front the Russian entrenchments rose out of the
vapours and fog in threatening silence; once beyond them,
and they were free! The country and military honour
called for this supreme sacrifice, and they offered it full
willingly.</p>

<p>At 9.30 a.m. the bugles sounded “Advance,” and the
whole line, two miles long, began to move in one grand
column. The Turks went at the quick, hurling a hail of
lead before them. The troops kept repeating the Arabic
phrase, “Bismillah rahmin!” (In the name of the merciful
God!), but the fire became so deadly that they came to a
dead-stop. The men in the front line lay down on their
stomachs. After an interval of ten minutes, the bugles
of the First Division sounded “Storm.”</p>

<p>The men jumped to their feet and rushed at the nearest
trench. A murderous discharge of rifle fire greeted them;
many bit the dust.</p>

<p>But very soon the Turks had the first trench in their
possession, then a second and third; and before they knew
what they were about, they were in the midst of the
Russian guns, hacking, clubbing, stabbing, shooting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
whilst overhead flew countless shells, hissing and leaving
a white trail in their track.</p>

<p>Then they waited for the support of the second line,
which never came; but at noon the Russians came down
upon them in force. Herbert was ordered to ride and
report that they could not hold out longer without reinforcements.
He says:</p>

<p>“As I rode towards the centre, I was drawn into the
vortex of a most awful panic&mdash;a wild flight for safety to
the right bank of the river.</p>

<p>“I had never been in a general retreat. It is far more
terrible than the most desperate encounter. I was simply
drawn along in a mad stream of men, horses, and carts.
Officers, their faces streaming with perspiration in spite
of the cold, were trying to restore order; the train got
mixed with the infantry and the batteries, and the confusion
baffles description. My horse slipped into a ditch,
and I continued on foot. I heard that Osman had been
wounded and carted across the river; the pitiless shells
followed us even to the other side of the river. The
screams of the women in the carts unnerved many a sturdy
man. I came to a sort of barn, where two Saloniki
horsemen stood sentry. Being dead-beat and hungry to
starving-point, I sat down on a stone. Whilst I crunched
a biscuit a cart drove up, and a man badly wounded in
the leg was assisted into the building. So sallow and
pain-drawn was his face that at first I failed to recognize
Osman. There were tears in his eyes&mdash;tears of grief and
rage rather than of physical pain&mdash;and in their expression
lay that awful thought, ‘The game is up, the end is
come,’ which we see in Meissonier’s picture of Napoleon
in the retreat from Waterloo.”</p>

<p>The last sortie from Plevna was witnessed by Skobeleff
from the heights above. The Turkish infantry were
deploying with great smartness, taking advantage of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
cover afforded by the ground. The skirmishers were
already out in the open, driving before them the Russian
outposts.</p>

<p>Skobeleff was very excited.</p>

<p>“Were there ever more skilful tactics?” he said.
“They are born soldiers, those Turks&mdash;already half-way
to Ganetzky’s front, hidden first by the darkness and now
by the long bank under which they are forming in perfect
safety. Beautiful indeed! Never was a sortie more
skilfully prepared. How I should like to be in command
of it!”</p>

<p>Skobeleff then turned his glass on the Russian defence
line. He seldom swore, but now a torrent of oaths burst
from his lips.</p>

<p>“Oh, that ass&mdash;that consummate ass&mdash;Ganetzky!” he
shouted, striking his thigh with his clenched fist. “What
fool’s work! He had his orders; he was warned of the
intended sortie; he might have had any number of reinforcements.
And what preparation has he made? None.
He is confronting Osman’s army with six battalions when
he might have had twenty-four. Mark my words: the
Turks will carry our first line with a rush. We shall
retrieve it, but to have lost it for ever so short a time will
be our disgrace for ever.” Then Skobeleff spat angrily
and rode off at a gallop. How true those words were we
have seen already.</p>

<p>At 2 p.m. Osman had been obliged to surrender, and
shortly after he met the Russian Grand Duke Nicholas&mdash;Osman
in a carriage, Nicholas on horseback. They
looked one another long in the face, then Nicholas offered
his hand heartily, and said:</p>

<p>“General, I honour you for your noble defence of
Plevna. It has been among the most splendid examples
of skill and heroism in modern history!”</p>

<p>Osman’s face winced a little&mdash;perhaps a twitch of pain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
crossed it&mdash;as, in spite of his wound, he struggled to his
feet and uttered a few broken words in a low tone. The
Russian officers saluted with great demonstration of respect,
and shouts of “Bravo!” rang out again and
again.</p>

<p>Poor victorious Osman! conquered at last by King
Famine. He had lived in a common green tent during
the whole period of the investment; his last night at
Plevna was the first he spent under a roof.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Herbert says concerning the surrender:
“As the Roumanian soldiers seized our weapons I became
possessed of an uncontrollable fury. I broke my sword,
thrust carbine, revolvers, and ammunition into the
waggon. A private with Semitic features perceived my
Circassian dagger, but I managed to spoil it by breaking
the point before handing it over. Another man annexed
my field-glass. I never saw my valise again, which had
been stored on one of the battalion’s carts. I had saved
a portion of my notes and manuscripts by carrying them
like a breast cuirass between uniform and vest. Having
given vent to rage, I fell into the opposite mood, and, sitting
down on a stone, I hid my face in my hands, and abandoned
myself to the bitterest half-hour of reflection I
have ever endured.”</p>

<p>Luckily Herbert fell in with a Roumanian Lieutenant
whom he knew, who took him to the Russian camp, and
gave him hot grog, bread, and cold meat. “How we
devoured the food!” he says. “We actually licked the
mugs out.”</p>

<p>As they walked away in the dark to their night quarters,
they happened to pass the spot where Herbert’s battalion
was encamped, without fires or tents, in an open, snow-covered
field, exposed to the north wind. Cries of distress
and rage greeted them, and they found that the
drunken Russian soldiers were robbing their Turkish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
prisoners, not only of watches, money, etc., but also of
their biscuits&mdash;their only food.</p>

<p>Herbert stopped for a minute, and gave away all he
had left; but some Russians jumped upon him and rifled
his pockets, before he could recall his companions to his
aid. Everybody in camp seemed to be drunk. Herbert
went to sleep in a mud hut, and slept for twelve hours
without awaking, being very kindly treated by a Russian
Major.</p>

<p>But the Turks suffered terribly. They spent the night of
the 10th on the same cold spot. Their arms had been
taken from them, also their money, biscuits, and even their
great-coats. It froze and snowed, and they were allowed
no fires.</p>

<p>It was a fortnight before all the prisoners had left the
neighbourhood; during this time from 3,000 to 4,000
men had succumbed to their privations. The defence of
Plevna had lasted 143 days. As the Grand Duke Nicholas
told Osman, it was one of the finest things done in military
history. But it cost the Russians 55,000 men, the Roumanians
10,000, and the Turks 30,000.</p>

<p>There is a Turkish proverb, “Though your enemy be
as small as an ant, yet act as if he were as big as an elephant.”
Had the Russians been guided by this, they
might have saved many losses.</p>

<p>“One bitterly cold morning, with two feet of snow on
the ground, I joined a detachment of prisoners, escorted
by Roumanians. We travelled viâ Sistoon to Bukarest,
crossing the Danube by the Russian pontoon bridge.
This journey, which lasted eight days, was the most
dreadful part of my experience, lying as it did through
snow-clad country, with storms and bitter winds. I and
fifty others had seats on carts; the bulk of the prisoners
had to tramp. I saw at least 400 men drop, to be taken
as little notice of as if they were so much offal, to die of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
starvation, or be devoured by the wolves which prowled
around our column.</p>

<p>“Over each man who fell a hideous crowd of crows,
ravens, vultures, hovered until he was exhausted enough
to be attacked with impunity.</p>

<p>“Some of the soldiers of the escort were extremely
brutal; others displayed a touching kindness; most were as
stolid and apathetic as their captives. Of Osman’s army
of 48,000 men, only 15,000 reached Russian soil; only
12,000 returned to their homes.</p>

<p>“In Bukarest our sufferings were at an end. In the
streets ladies distributed coffee, broth, bread, tobacco,
cigarettes, spirit. Our quarters in the barracks appeared
to us like Paradise.”</p>

<p>Then by train to Kharkoff, where Herbert got a cheque
from his father, and was allowed much freedom on parole;
he made many friends, was lionized and feasted and fattened
“like a show beast.” “I was treated,” he says,
“with all the chivalrous kindness and open-handed hospitality
which are the characteristics of the educated
Russians. The effects of the brutal propensities developed
in warfare wore off speedily, and I am now a
mild and inoffensive being, whose conscience does not
allow the killing of a flea or the plucking of a flower!”</p>

<span class="smaller">SIEGE OF KHARTOUM (1884)</span></h2>

<p class="summary">Gordon invited to the Soudan&mdash;The Mahdi&mdash;Chinese Gordon&mdash;His
religious feeling&mdash;Not supported by England&mdash;Arabs attack&mdash;Blacks
as cowards&mdash;Pashas shot&mdash;The <i>Abbas</i> sent down with
Stewart&mdash;Her fate&mdash;Relief coming&mdash;Provisions fail&mdash;A sick

Charles Wilson and Beresford steam up&mdash;The rapids and
sand-bank&mdash;“Do you see the flag?”&mdash;“Turn and fly”&mdash;Gordon’s
fate.</p>

<p>In January, 1884, Charles Gordon was asked by the
British Government to go to Egypt and withdraw from
the Soudan the garrisons, the civil officials, and any of
the inhabitants who might wish to be taken away. It
was a dangerous duty he had to perform, as the Mahdi,
a religious pretender in whom many believed, had just
annihilated an Egyptian army led by an Englishman,
Hicks Pasha, and, supported by the Arab slave-dealers,
had revolted against Egyptian rule.</p>

<p>Gordon had some years before been Governor-General
of the Soudan for the Khedive Ismail. He had been
then offered £10,000 a year, but would not take more
than £2,000, for he knew it would be “blood money
wrung from the wretches under his rule.” When previously
“Chinese Gordon,” as he was called, had put
down the Taiping rebels for the Chinese Government, he
refused the enormous treasure which was offered him, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
order to mark his resentment at the treachery of the
Emperor for having executed the rebel chiefs after Gordon
had promised them their lives.</p>

<p>Gordon was a man of simple piety. “God dwells in
us”&mdash;this was the doctrine he most valued. After the
Bible, the “Imitation of Christ,” the writings of Epictetus
and Marcus Aurelius, seem to have been his
favourites. He once wrote: “Amongst troubles and
worries no one can have peace till he stays his soul upon
his God. It gives a man superhuman strength....
The quiet, peaceful life of our Lord was solely due to His
submission to God’s will.”</p>

<p>Such was the man whom England sent out too late to
face the rising storm of Arab rebellion. Gordon reached
Khartoum on the 18th of February, taking up his quarters
in the palace which had been his home in years before.
He had come, he said, without troops, nor would he fight
with any weapons but justice. The chains were struck
off from the limbs of the prisoners in the dungeons.</p>

<p>“I shall make them love me,” he said; and the black
people came in their thousands to kiss his feet, calling
him “the Sultan of the Soudan.”</p>

<p>But time went by, and Gordon could not get the
Government at home to second his schemes, so that the
natives began to lose confidence in him, and sided with
the Mahdi.</p>

<p>The Arabs began to attack Khartoum on the 12th of
March, and from that date until his death Gordon was
engaged in defending the city. Khartoum is situated on
the western bank of the Blue Nile, on a spit of sand
between the junction of that river with the White Nile.
Nearly all the records of this period have been lost, but
it is proved that wire entanglements were stretched in
front of the earthworks, mines were laid down, the
Yarrow-built steamers were made bullet-proof and fur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>nished
with towers, guns were mounted on the public
buildings, and expeditions in search of food were sent
out.</p>

<p>It was Gordon’s habit to go up on the roof at sunrise
and scan the country around.</p>

<p>“I am not alone,” he would say, “for He is ever with
me.”</p>

<p>On the 16th of March he had to look upon his native
troops retiring before the rebel horsemen. He writes:</p>

<p>“Our gun with the regulars opened fire. Very soon a
body of about sixty rebel horsemen charged down upon
my Bashi-Bazouks, who fired a volley, then turned and
fled. The horsemen galloped towards my square of
regulars, which they immediately broke. The whole
force then retreated slowly towards the fort with their
rifles shouldered. The men made no effort to stand, and
the gun was abandoned. Pursuit ceased about a mile
from stockade, and there the men rallied. We brought
in the wounded. Nothing could be more dismal than
seeing these horsemen, and some men even on camels,
pursuing close to troops, who with arms shouldered
plodded their way back.”</p>

<p>But Gordon was no weak humanitarian. Two Pashas
were tried, and found guilty of cowardice, and were
promptly shot&mdash;<i>pour encourager les autres</i>. After that he
tried to train his men to face the enemy by little skirmishes,
and he made frequent sallies with his river
steamers.</p>

<p>“You see,” he wrote, “when you have steam on the
men can’t run away.”</p>

<p>Then began a long and weary waiting for the relief
which came not until it was too late. The Arabs kept
on making attacks, which they never pressed home,
expecting to effect a surrender from scarcity of food.</p>

<p class="header">A Strange Weapon of Offence</p>

<p>Lieut. Herbert was ordered to paste some labels at the ambulance doors in Plevna.
In passing a dark lane someone sprang at him and seized his paste-pot, no doubt taking
it for food. To defend himself he belaboured and plastered his opponents’ face with
the paste-brush, and later on those of two others. He then turned and ran.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In September only three months’ food remained. No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
news came from England; they knew not if England even
thought of them. The population of Khartoum was at
first about 60,000 souls; nearly 20,000 of these were sent
away as the siege went on as being friends of the Mahdi.</p>

<p>On the 9th of September Gordon sent down the Nile,
in a small paddle-boat named the <i>Abbas</i>, Colonel Stewart,
Mr. Power, M. Herbin, the French Consul, some Greeks,
and about fifty soldiers. They took with them letters,
journals, dispatches which were to be sent from Dongola.
The <i>Abbas</i> drew little water, the river was in full flood,
and they seemed likely to be able to get over the rapids
with safety. Henceforth Gordon was alone with his
black and Egyptian troops. One might have thought
that his heart would have sunk within him at the loneliness
of his situation, at the feeling of desertion by England,
and of treachery in his own garrison. He had no
friend to speak to, no sympathetic companion left at
Khartoum. Yes, he had one Friend left, and in his
journal he tells us that he was happier and more peaceful
now than in the earlier months of the siege.</p>

<p>“He is always with me. May our Lord not visit us
as a nation for our sins, but may His wrath fall on me,
hid in Christ. This is my frequent prayer, and may He
spare these people and bring them to peace.”</p>

<p>The ill-fated <i>Abbas</i> was wrecked, her passengers and
crew were murdered, her papers were taken to the Mahdi,
who now knew exactly how long Khartoum could hold
out against famine.</p>

<p>On the 21st of September Gordon first heard the news
of a relief expedition being sent from England, and three
days later he resolved to dispatch armed steamers to
Metemma down the Nile to await the arrival of our troops.
They started on the 30th, taking with them many of
Gordon’s best men; but Gordon went on, drilling, feeding
the hungry, visiting the sick, writing hopefully, and some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>times
merrily, in his journals. For instance, writing of an
official who had telegraphed, “I should like to be informed
exactly when Gordon expects to be in difficulties
as to provisions and ammunition,” Gordon remarks:</p>

<p>“This man must be preparing a great statistical work.
If he will only turn to his archives he will see we have
been in difficulties for provisions for some months. It is
as if a man on the bank, having seen his friend in a river
already bobbed down two or three times, hails, ‘I say,
old fellow, let us know when we are to throw you the
life-buoy. I know you have bobbed down two or three
times, but it is a pity to throw you the life-buoy until
you are <i>in extremis</i>, and I want to know exactly.’”</p>

<p>On the 21st of October the Mahdi arrived before Khartoum,
and Gordon was informed of the loss of the <i>Abbas</i>
and the death of his friends. To this Gordon replied:</p>

<p>“Tell the Mahdi that it is all one to me whether he has
captured 20,000 steamers like the <i>Abbas</i>&mdash;I am here like
iron.”</p>

<p>On the 2nd of November there were left provisions for
six weeks, and he could not put the troops on half rations,
lest they should desert.</p>

<p>On the 12th an attack was made upon Omdurman, a
little way down the river, and on Gordon’s steamers
<i>Ismailia</i> and <i>Hussineyeh</i>. The latter was struck by shells,
and had to be run aground. In the journal we read:</p>

<p>“From the roof of the palace I saw that poor little beast
<i>Hussineyeh</i> fall back, stern foremost, under a terrific fire
of breechloaders. I saw a shell strike the water at her
bows; I saw her stop and puff off steam, and then I gave
the glass to my boy, <i>sickened unto death</i>. My boy (he is
thirty) said, ‘<i>Hussineyeh</i> is sick.’ I knew it, but said
quietly, ‘Go down and telegraph to Mogrim, “Is <i>Hussineyeh</i>
sick?”’”</p>

<p>On the 22nd of November Gordon summed up his losses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
He had lost nearly 1,900 men, and 242 had been wounded.
And where were the English boats that were to hurry up
the Nile to his rescue?</p>

<p>On the 30th of November only one boat had passed the
third cataract, the remaining 600 were creaking and
groaning under the huge strain that was hauling them
painfully through the “Womb of Rocks.”</p>

<p>In December the desertions from the garrison increased,
as the food-supply decreased. There was not fifteen days’
food left now in Khartoum. So the steamer <i>Bordein</i> was
sent down to Shendy with letters and his journal. In a
letter to his sister he writes:</p>

<p>“I am quite happy, thank God! and, like Lawrence, I
have <i>tried</i> to do my duty.”</p>

<p>The last entry in his journal runs as follows:</p>

<p>“I have done the best for the honour of our country.
Good-bye. You send me no information, though you
have lots of money.”</p>

<p>Evidently this high-souled man was cut to the heart
by what he thought was the ingratitude and neglect of
England. He could not know that thousands of Englishmen
and Canadians were toiling up the Nile flood to save
him, if it were possible. But alas! they all started too
late, since valuable time had been wasted in long arguments
held in London as to which might be the best
route to Khartoum.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, starvation was beginning: strange things
were eaten by those who still remained faithful to the
last. Only 14,000 now were left in the city. But
Omdurman had been taken, the Arabs were pressing
closer and fiercer, and Egyptian officers came to Gordon
clamouring for surrender. Then he would go up upon
the roof, his face set, his teeth clenched. He would strain
his eyes in looking to the north for some sign, some tiny
sign of help coming. He cared not for his own life&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>“The
Almighty God will help me,” he wrote&mdash;but he did
care for the honour of England, and that honour seemed
to him to be sullied by our leaving him here at bay&mdash;and
all alone!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the English had fought their way to Gubat,
where they found the steamers which Gordon had sent
to meet them. So tired were the men that, after a drink
of river-water, they fell down like logs. Four of Gordon’s
steamers, with Sir Charles Wilson and Captain C. Beresford,
started from Gubat on the 24th of January with
twenty English soldiers and some undisciplined blacks.
They were like the London penny steamers, that one shell
would have sent to the bottom. They were heavily laden
with Indian corn, fuel, and dura for the Khartoum garrison.
Each steamer flew two Egyptian flags, one at the
foremast and one at the stern. Every day they had to
stop for wood to supply the engines, when the men would
be off after loot or fresh meat.</p>

<p>When they reached the cataract and rapids the <i>Bordein</i>
struck on a rock, and could not be moved for many hours,
the Nile water running like a mill-race under her keel.
Arabs on the bank were taking pot-shots at her, and the
blacks on board grinned good-humouredly, and replied
with a wasteful fusillade. After shifting the guns and
stores, the crew got the <i>Bordein</i> to move on the 26th of
January, but only to get fast upon a sand-bank. Precious
time was thus lost, and on the 27th of January a camel
man shouted from the bank that Khartoum was taken
and Gordon killed. No one believed this news.</p>

<p>Near Halfiyeh a heavy fire was opened upon them at
600 yards from four guns and many rifles. The gunners
on the steamers were naked, and looked like demons in
the smoke.</p>

<p>“One huge giant was the very incarnation of savagery
drunk with war,” writes Sir Charles Wilson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>

<p>When the steamers had passed the batteries the
Soudanese crews screamed with delight, lifting up their
rifles and shaking them above their heads.</p>

<p>Soon they saw the Government House at Khartoum
above the trees, and excitement stirred every heart.
The Soudanese commander, Khashm el Mus, kept on
saying, “Do you see the flag?”</p>

<p>No one could see the flag.</p>

<p>“Then something has happened!” he muttered.</p>

<p>However, there was no help for it; they had to go on
past Tuti Island and Omdurman, spattered and flogged
with thousands of bullets.</p>

<p>“It is all over&mdash;all over!” groaned Khashm, as to the
sound of the Nordenfeldt was added the deeper note of
the Krupp guns from Khartoum itself.</p>

<p>As they reached the “Elephant’s Trunk”&mdash;so the
sand-spit was called below Khartoum&mdash;they saw hundreds
of Dervishes ranged under their banners in order to resist
a landing; so the order was given with a heavy heart:
“Turn her, and run full speed down.” Then the Soudanese
on board, who till now had been fighting enthusiastically,
collapsed and sank wearily on the deck. The poor fellows
had lost their all&mdash;wives, families, houses!</p>

<p>“What is the use of firing? I have lost all,” said
Khashm, burying his face in his mantle.</p>

<p>But they got him upon his legs, and the moment of
sorrowful despair changed again to desperate revenge.
After all the steamers got safely back.</p>

<p>And General Gordon&mdash;we left him alone in command
of a hungry garrison&mdash;what of him? From examinations
of Gordon’s officers taken later it seems that before daylight
on the 26th of January the Arabs attacked one of
the gates, and met with little or no resistance. There
was reason to fear treachery. For some three hours the
Arabs went through the city killing every one they met.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
Some of them went to the palace, and there met Gordon
walking in front of a small party of men. He was probably
going to the church, where the ammunition was
stored, to make his last stand. The rebels fired a volley,
and Gordon fell dead. It is reported that his head was
cut off and exposed above the gate at Omdurman. We
may be glad that it was a sudden death&mdash;called away by
the God in whom he trusted so simply. Thus died one
of England’s greatest heroes, one of the world’s most
holy men.</p>

<p>The siege had lasted 317 days, nine days less than the
siege of Sebastopol, and the Mahdi ascribed the result to
his God. In a letter sent to the British officers on the
steamers he says:</p>

<p>“God has destroyed Khartoum and other places by
our hands. Nothing can withstand His power and might,
and by the bounty of God all has come into our hands.
There is no God but God.</p>

triumph&mdash;Relief at last&mdash;Their perils&mdash;Saved by a dog&mdash;Second

<p>In 1874 Sir Garnet Wolseley captured Kumassi, the
capital of the Ashantis, whose country lies in the interior
of the Gold Coast, in West Africa. In March, 1900, Sir
Frederick Hodgson, Governor of the Gold Coast, set out
with Lady Hodgson and a large party of carriers and
attendants to visit Ashantiland. They had no anticipation
of any trouble arising, and on their march held several
palavers with friendly Kings and chiefs.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the 25th of March, they entered Kumassi
in state. At the brow of a steep hill the European officials
met the Governor’s party, and escorted them into the
town. At the base of the hill they had to cross a swamp
on a high causeway, and then ascend a shorter hill to
the fort. Some children under the Basel missionaries sang
“God Save the Queen!” at a spot where only a few years
before human sacrifices and every species of horrible torture
used to be enacted.</p>

<p>Soon they passed under a triumphal arch, decorated
with palms, having “Welcome” worked upon it in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
flowers. Near the fort were assembled in a gorgeous
pageant native Kings and chiefs, with their followers, who
all rose up to salute the Governor, while the royal umbrellas
of state were rapidly whirled round and round to
signify the general applause. Everything seemed to
promise order and contentment. But that night Lady
Hodgson was informed by her native servants that very
bad fetishes, or portents, had been passed on the road
through the forest. One of these was a fowl split open
while still alive, and laid upon a fetish stone; another
was a string of eggs twined about a fetish house; a third
was the presence of little mounds of earth to represent
graves&mdash;a token that the white man would find burial
in Ashanti.</p>

<p>The next day Lady Hodgson went to see the once
famous Fetish Grove&mdash;the place into which the bodies of
those slain for human sacrifices were thrown. Most of
its trees had been blown up with dynamite in 1896, when
our troops had marched in to restore order, and the bones
and skulls had been buried. The executioners&mdash;a
hereditary office&mdash;used to have a busy time in the old
days, for every offence was punished by mutilation or
death; for, as the King of the Quia country once told the
boys at Harrow School, “We have no prisons, and we
have to chop off ear or nose or hand, and let the rascal go.”</p>

<p>But the Ashanti victim had the right of appealing to
the King against his sentence. This right had become a
dead-letter, because, as soon as the sentence of execution
had been pronounced, the victim was surrounded by a
clamorous crowd, and a sharp knife was run through one
cheek, through the tongue, and so out through the other
cheek, which somewhat impeded his power of appeal.
One would have thought that English rule and white
justice would have been a pleasant change after the
severity of the native law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>

<p>The fort is a good square building, with rounded
bastions at the four corners. On each of these bastions is
a platform on which can be worked a Maxim gun, each
gun being protected by a roof above and by iron shutters
at the sides. The only entrance to the fort lies on the
south, where are heavy iron bullet-proof gates, which
can be secured by heavy beams resting in slots in the wall.
The walls of the fort are loopholed, and inside are platforms
for those who are defending to shoot from. There
is a well of good water in one corner of the square. The
ground all round the fort was cleared, and it would be
very difficult for an enemy to cross the open in any
assault.</p>

<p>As soon as the Governor of the Gold Coast knew that
the Ashanti Kings were bent on war, he telegraphed for
help from the coast and from the north, where most of
the Hausa troops were employed. They were 150 miles
away from help, with a climate hot and unhealthy, the
rainy season being near at hand; and they were surrounded
by warlike and savage tribes. Fortunately,
some of the native Kings, with their followers, were loyal
to the English Queen; these tried to persuade the rebels
to desist from revolt, and lay their grievances before the
Governor in palaver. But the more they tried to pacify
them, the more insolent were their demands. The first
detachment of Hausa troops arrived on the 18th of April,
to the great joy of the little garrison; but soon after their
arrival the market began to fail: the natives dare not come
with food-stuffs, and the roads were now closed. On
the 25th a Maxim gun was run out of the fort to check
the advance of the Ashantis; but they possessed themselves
of the town, and loopholed the huts near the fort.
The loyal inhabitants of Kumassi had left their homes,
and were crowded outside the walls of the fort, bringing
with them their portable goods, being upwards of 3,000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
men, women, and children. The gates of the fort had
hitherto remained open, but it was evident that the small
English force would be compelled to concentrate in the
fort; and as the refugees seemed to be bent on rushing
the gates for safer shelter, the order was given to close
the gates.</p>

<p>“Gradually the gate guard was removed one by one, and
then came the work of shutting the gates and barricading
them. Never shall I forget the sight. My heart stood still,
for I knew that were this panic-stricken crowd to get in, the
fort would fall an easy prey to the rebels, and we should
be lost. It was an anxious moment. Could the guards
close the gates in face of that rushing multitude? A
moment later, and the suspense was over. There was a
desperate struggle, a cry, a bang, and the refugees fell
back.” Then they tried to climb up by the posts of the
veranda. So sentries had to be posted on the veranda
to force them down again. “I felt very much for these
poor folk,” writes Lady Hodgson; “but, besides the fact
that the fort would not have accommodated a third of
them, the whole space was wanted for our troops.”</p>

<p>The hours of that day went on, with sniping from all
sides. Sometimes the rebels would come out into the
open to challenge a fight, but the machine guns made
them aware that boldness was not the best policy.</p>

<p>At night, when our men flung themselves down to rest,
the whole sky was lit up with the fire of the Hausa cantonments
and of the town. Tongues of fire were leaping up
to the skies on all sides, lighting up the horrors of the
scene around, affrighting the women and children, and
adding to the anxiety of all.</p>

<p>Night at Kumassi was not a time of quiet repose; the
incessant chatter of the men and women just outside the
walls, the yelling and squealing of children, all made
sleep difficult. And there was ever the thought under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>lying
all that to-morrow might be the end, that the fort
might be rushed by numbers.</p>

<p>But, as it turned out, the 26th dawned quietly. So,
later in the day, a strong escort of Hausas was sent to the
hospital to recover, if possible, the drugs and medical
stores which had been abandoned through lack of carriers
when the sick were brought into the fort. Fortunately,
the rebels had left the drugs and stores untouched, and
they were brought in with thankful alacrity.</p>

<p>The next night there was a hurricane of wind rushing
through the forest trees and drenching the poor refugees,
who tried to light fires to keep themselves warm.</p>

<p>“There was a dear old Hausa sentry on the veranda
near my bedroom, who regarded me as his special charge.
On this occasion, and on others, when my curiosity
prompted me to go on the veranda to see what was
happening, this old man would push me back, saying in
very broken English, ‘Go to room&mdash;Ashanti man come&mdash;very
bad. You no come out, miss.’”</p>

<p>It had been hoped that by the 29th of April the Lagos
Hausas would have arrived to rescue them, but they did
not come, and the rebels fired the hospital. Not liking
our shells bursting amongst them, the Ashantis, instead of
retiring, swarmed out into the open, and advanced upon
the fort. The refugees were cowering down close to the
walls, and around them were the Hausa outposts ready
with their rifles. In the fort were the gunners standing
to their guns. As the rebels came on, jumping and shouting,
and dancing and firing, the Maxims opened upon
them; still they came on, and now the Hausa outposts
took up the fire. At last the fight became a hand-to-hand
struggle, and the guns in the fort had to cease firing, lest
they should hit friend and foe alike. Then some 200
loyal natives, led by Captain Armitage, sallied out to
the fight. “At their head were their chiefs, promi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>nent
amongst whom was the young King of Aguna,
dressed in his fetish war-coat, in the form of a ‘jumper,’
and hung back and front with fetish charms made from
snake and other skins. He also wore a pair of thick
leather boots, and where these ended his black legs began,
and continued until they met well above the knee a short
trouser of coloured cotton. He also wore a fierce-looking
head-dress, and carried war charms made of elephant
tails. Proudly and well did he bear himself; and at
last, to our joy, a great cheer rose in the distance, and
proclaimed that the enemy were retiring. Soon King
Aguna came back, triumphantly carried on the shoulders
of two of his warriors to the gate of the fort, where he met
with a great ovation from his ‘ladies,’ who flocked round
him, pressing forward to shake his hand and congratulate
him upon the victory.” So the day was won, and with
the loss of only one man killed and three wounded, as the
rebels fired over our heads.</p>

<p>Captain Middlemist had been too ill to take the command,
and it devolved upon Captain G. Marshall, Royal
West Kent Regiment, who, after his severe exertions,
suddenly succumbed, and was brought into quarters half
delirious. The heat of the sun, the excitement, and the
work had been too much for him; fortunately, he was well
again the next day.</p>

<p>By this victory the rebels had been driven out of
Kumassi and across the swamps; they had left behind
large supplies of food and war stores, which the garrison
secured; even the refugees outside the walls began to
smile and sing. It is astonishing how these children of
Nature suddenly change from the depth of woe to an
ecstasy and delirium of delight.</p>

<p>But where were the Lagos Hausas all this time?</p>

<p>Four o’clock came, five o’clock came, and still no sign
of their arriving. Anxious faces scanned the Cape Coast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
road. Something must have happened to them; they
had been met, checked, repulsed.</p>

<p>But at half-past five firing was heard in the forest.
“There they are,” said each to his neighbour, and a
feverish excitement made numbers run to the veranda
posts, and climb up to get a better view. A force also
was sent down the road to meet them. How slow the
time went with the watchers in the fort!</p>

<p>Just before six o’clock there was a yell from the loyal
natives, and shouts announced that the Hausas were
coming round the bend of the road. The relief came in
through two long lines of natives, who wanted to see the
brave fellows who had fought their way up to Kumassi
from the coast. But, poor fellows! they had had a
terrible time: their officers were all wounded; they had
had nothing to eat or drink since early morning, and they
were fearfully exhausted.</p>

<p>However, after they had slept a few hours and drunk
some tea, they were able to tell their tale. Captain Aplin,
who led them, said:</p>

<p>“We got on all right till we came to a village called
Esiago, when we were attacked on both sides by a large
force concealed among the trees. I formed the men up
two deep, kneeling, and facing the bush on either side.
By Jove! it was a perfect hail of slugs; and we could not
see a soul, as the black chaps slid down the trunks of the
trees into the jungle. Captain Cochrane, who was with
the Maxim, was hit in the shoulder, but would not leave
his post, and Dr. Macfarlane was wounded while tending
him. Then the machine-guns became overheated and
jammed, and had to cease firing. Four times the enemy
returned to the attack. I got this graze on my cheek
from a bullet which passed through my orderly’s leg.</p>

<p>“Next day, after crossing the Ordah River, we were
attacked at eleven a.m., and the fight lasted till five in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
evening. A sudden turn in the track, and we saw a
strongly-built stockade, horseshoe shape. Some Ashantis
were looking over the top and peering between the logs.
The track was so narrow that we had no front for firing,
and the whole path was swept by their guns. I told off
Captain Cochrane to outflank the stockade. He, with
thirty Hausas, crept away into the bush to do so. Meanwhile,
we ran short of ammunition, and had to load with
gravel and stones. When I told the men to fix bayonets
ready for a charge, I found they were so done up they
could hardly stand. Our hour seemed to have struck,
and the guns had again jammed. Just then three volleys
sounded near the stockade. Cochrane was enfilading them.
Hurrah! Instantly the Ashanti fire began to slacken.
One charge, and it was ours.”</p>

<p>Amongst those who had come in with the Hausas was
Mr. Branch, an officer in the telegraph department. In
reply to Lady Hodgson as to how he was so lame, he
replied:</p>

<p>“I and my men were busy putting the line right to
Kumassi. We were peacefully going through the forest
when&mdash;bang! one of my hammock-men went down, shot,
and the rest, carriers and all, threw down their loads,
and bolted into the tangle of trees and undergrowth. By
good luck, I had taken off my helmet and placed it at the
foot of my hammock. The rebels thought it was my head,
and every gun was blazing away at my poor helmet. It
was fairly riddled, I can tell you. I jumped out of the
hammock, and made for the bush; but it was so thick and
thorny, the brutes caught me and beat me with sticks
about the legs and feet, so that I can scarcely walk, as
you see. Well, it was my poor terrier dog that saved me;
for he came nosing after me, but somehow took a wrong
turn, was fired on and wounded, and went off whimpering
into the bush in a different direction. The Ashantis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
followed my doggie, thinking he was with me; so I got
away from them that night. I wandered about, trying
to find the village, where a Kokofu chief was friendly to
me. As daylight came I heard natives talking, and threw
myself down under some leaves, thinking it would be
rather unpleasant to be taken and tortured. Well, they
came up, saw the grass had been disturbed, stopped,
examined, found me! I was done for! No, I was not.
I saw by their grinning and other signs that they were
friendly. In fact, my carriers had told the friendly chief
about me, and he had sent these men to bring me back;
they had been looking for me all night. They carried me
back to Esumeja, where I stayed until the Lagos Hausas
came up on the 27th of April.”</p>

<p>Next day the garrison of Kumassi found that their
rescuers had been compelled to abandon their rice, and
to fire away most of their ammunition on the road. Now
there were 250 more mouths to feed, and food was running
short. Rations were served out every morning, and it
was a very delicate operation, for the loyal natives
thought it a clever thing to steal a tin of beef or biscuits.
The biscuits and tinned meat had been stored four years
in a tropical climate; the meat-tins were covered inside
by a coating of green mould, and the biscuits were either
too hard to bite or were half-eaten already by weevils.
Captain Middleton died on the 6th of May, and when he
was buried, his “boy” Mounchi lay down on his master’s
grave like a faithful dog and sobbed bitterly. That boy
became a famous nurse; they called him the “Rough
Diamond.” The poor refugees had now left the walls
of the fort and had gone to their huts; they looked so
wan and piteous.</p>

<p>Night after night there came a fearful noise of drumming
from the rebel camps. The loyal chiefs said the
drums were beating out defiance and challenge to fight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why not send for more white men?” Ah! why did
they not come?</p>

<p>Every day news came of a rescue column; every night
the rumour was proved false.</p>

<p>On the 15th of May, about 3.30 p.m., there was a terrific
hubbub all round the fort. Officers rushed on to the
veranda to see what was the matter. Hundreds of
friendly natives were streaming along the north road.</p>

<p>“What is it, chief?”</p>

<p>“Heavy loads of food coming in. Much eat! much eat&mdash;very
good for belly!”</p>

<p>In a few minutes the garrison saw a joyful sight:
Major Morris leading in his troops from the northern territories&mdash;such
a fine body of men, all wearing the picturesque
many-coloured straw hats of the north. Some of
the officers were on ponies. Oh, what shaking of hands!
what delightful chatter! But they, too, had had to fight
their way through several stockades, and some were
wounded.</p>

<p>“The arrival of Major Morris,” writes Lady Hodgson,
“seemed to take a load off our minds. He was so cheery,
confident, and resourceful, and seemed always able to raise
the spirits of the faint-hearted.... But the large
loads of food did not in reality exist: they had only
brought enough to last a week; they had, however,
brought plenty of ammunition.”</p>

<p>Major Morris was now in command of 750 of all ranks,
and he resolved to make a reconnaissance in force. They
went after the rebels far from the fort, and whilst they
were away fighting, the wives of the refugees were doing
a slow funeral dance up and down the road, chanting a
mournful dirge, their faces and bodies daubed with white
paint. In spite of this appeal to their gods, many
wounded were carried back to the fort.</p>

<p>Many a weary day came and went; no strong relief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
came&mdash;no news. The natives were dying of starvation:
some went mad and shrieked; others sat still and picked
their cloth to pieces. It was bad enough for all. A rat
cost ten shillings; all pets had been eaten long ago.</p>

<p>Then it was determined that the Governor and Lady
Hodgson and most of the garrison should try to force
their way to the coast, as there were only three days’
supply of rations left. The 23rd of June was to be the day
of departure.</p>

<p>The Governor’s last words to the men left behind in
the fort were: “Well, you have a supply of food for
twenty-three days, and are safe for that period; but we
are going to die to-day.” Captain Bishop was left in
command of the fort, with a small force.</p>

<p>From Captain Bishop’s report we learn that Major
Morris had scarcely left Kumassi when he saw a band of
Ashantis coming towards the fort from their stockade.
They thought, no doubt, that the fort had been deserted,
but the fire from two Maxims soon convinced them to
the contrary. The refugees, who had built shelters round
the walls, had all, with the exception of 150, gone away
with the Governor’s column; but their empty shelters
formed a pestilential area: over them hovered vultures&mdash;a
sure proof of what some of them contained&mdash;and one
of the first duties of the little garrison was to burn them
up, after examining their contents.</p>

<p>The day after the column left three men died of starvation,
and almost daily one or more succumbed. When
no relief came, as promised&mdash;though they had been told
it was only sixteen miles off&mdash;their hopes fell, and after
ten days they gave up all hope of surviving.</p>

<p>“But,” he says, “we kept up an appearance of cheerfulness
for the sake of our men. I regard the conduct of
the native troops as marvellous; they maintained perfect
discipline, and never complained. Some were too weak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
even to stand at the table to receive their rations, and
lay about on the ground. All were worn to skin and bone,
but there were a few who, to relieve their hunger, had
been eating poisonous herbs, which caused great swellings
of the body. Sometimes native women would come
outside the fort and offer to sell food. A penny piece of
cocoa realized fifteen shillings; bananas were eighteen-pence
each; half a biscuit could be bought for three
shillings. This may give some idea of the scarcity of
food.</p>

<p>“On the 14th of July we heard terrific firing at 4.30 p.m.
Hopes jumped up again, but most of the men were too weak
to care for anything. It was very pathetic that now, when
relief was at hand, some of the men were just at the point
of death.</p>

<p>“At 4.45, amid the din of the ever-approaching firing,
we heard ringing British cheers, and a shell passed over
the top of the fort. We soon saw shells bursting in all
directions about 400 yards off, and we fired a Maxim to
show that we were alive. Then, to our intense relief,
we heard a distant bugle sound the ‘Halt!’ and at six
o’clock on this Sunday evening, the 15th of July, we saw
the heads of the advance guard emerge from the bush,
with a fox-terrier trotting gaily in front.</p>

<p>“Instantly the two buglers on the veranda sounded the
‘Welcome,’ blowing it over and over again in their
excitement. A few minutes later a group of white helmets
told us of the arrival of the staff, and we rushed out of the
fort, cheering to the best of our ability. The meeting
with our rescuers was of a most affecting character.</p>

<p>“Colonel Willcocks and his officers plainly showed what
they had gone through. The whole of the force was
halted in front of the fort, and three cheers for the Queen
and the waving of caps and helmets formed an evening
scene that none of us will ever forget.” So they won<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
through by pluck and patience&mdash;33 Europeans and some
720 Hausas opposing many thousands of savage and cruel
natives.</p>

<p>And what about the Governor’s party?</p>

<p>They stole away on the morning of the 23rd of June in
a blue-white mist, through the swamp and the clinging
bush, till they came to a stockade. Then they were seen
by the Ashantis, who began to beat their tom-toms and
drums, signalling for help from other camps. But they
took the stockade, and found beyond it a nice little camp;
before every hut a fire was burning and food cooking, and
no one to look after it. Many a square meal was hurriedly
snatched and eaten, but some who were too greedy and
stayed behind to eat fell victims to the returning foe.</p>

<p>Then came a terrible wrestling with bad roads and
sniping blacks and a deluge of rain, and most of their
boxes were thrown away or lost.</p>

<p>Of course there were many cases of theft. On the third
night two men were brought into the village in a dying
state. One of them was clasping in his hand a label
taken from a bottle of Scrubb’s ammonia. They had
broken open a box, and finished the two bottles which
they found there: one was whisky, the other ammonia!</p>

<p>Lady Hodgson writes: “One stream I remember well;
it was some 30 feet wide, and flowing swiftly. Across
it was a tree-trunk, very slippery. How was I to get over?
The difficulty was solved by my cook carrying me over in
his arms. He was a tall man, and managed to take me
over safely; but more than once he stumbled, and I
thought I should be dropped into the torrent. Often the
road led through high reeds and long grass, and many a
time I thought we had lost our way, and might suddenly
emerge into some unfriendly village, to be taken prisoners
or cut down.</p>

<p>“At last N’kwanta came in sight, perched on a hill.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
We could see the Union Jack flying on a flagstaff in the
centre of the town, and the King’s people drawn up to
receive the Governor. We were at last among friends.</p>

<p>“Fires were burning everywhere, and the cooking of
food was the sole pursuit. Our poor starved Hausas had
now before them the diet in which their hearts delighted.
It was a pleasant sight to see the joy with which they
welcomed their altered prospects, and the dispersal of
the gloom which had so long rested upon all of us like a
pall.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</a><br />
<span class="smaller">MAFEKING (1899-1900)</span></h2>

<p class="summary">Snyman begins to fire&mdash;A flag of truce&mdash;Midnight sortie&mdash;The dynamite
trolley&mdash;Kaffirs careless&mdash;A cattle raid&mdash;Eloff nearly takes
Mafeking&mdash;Is taken himself instead&mdash;The relief dribble in&mdash;At
2 a.m. come cannon with Mahon and Plumer.</p>

<p>On the 7th of October, 1899, Colonel Baden-Powell issued
a notice to the people of Mafeking, in which he told them
that “forces of armed Boers are now massed upon the
Natal and Bechuanaland borders. Their orders are not
to cross the border until the British fire a shot. As this
is not likely to occur, at least for some time, no immediate
danger is to be apprehended.... It is possible they
might attempt to shell the town, and although every
endeavour will be made to provide shelter for the women
and children, yet arrangements could be made to move
them to a place of safety if they desire to go away from
Mafeking....”</p>

<p>Mafeking is situated upon a rise about 300 yards north of
the Matopo River. The railway, which runs north to Buluwayo,
is to the west of the town, and crosses the river by
an iron bridge. To the west of the railway is the native
stadt, which consists of Kaffir huts, being called in
Kaffir language “The Place Among the Rocks.”</p>

<p>The centre of the town is the market-square, from which
bungalows built of mud-bricks, with roofs of corrugated
iron, extend regularly into the veldt. The streets were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
barricaded, and the houses protected by sand-bags. An
armour-plated train, fitted with quick-firing guns,
patrolled the railway at times. The population during the
siege included 1,500 whites and 8,000 natives. The town
was garrisoned by the Cape Police and by the Protectorate
Regiment, under Colonel Hore, by the Town Guard, and
volunteers.</p>

<p>Great was the excitement of the inhabitants as the day
of bombardment drew near. They had been very busy
constructing earthworks and gun-emplacements, piling
up tiers of sand-bags and banks of earth to face them;
some had dug deep pits to sit in, but at first such makeshifts
were derided by the inexperienced.</p>

<p>It had been notified that a red flag would fly from headquarters
if an attack were threatening, together with an
alarm bell rung in the centre of the town. Mines had
been placed outside the town, and a telephone attached.</p>

<p>Commandant Snyman had prophesied that when he did
begin to bombard Mafeking English heads would roll on
the veldt like marbles. Mafeking had no artillery to speak
of, so no wonder that many hearts felt uneasy tremors
as the fatal Monday drew near. Yet curiosity ofttimes
overcame fear, and many coigns of vantage were chosen
by those who wished to climb up and see the gory sport.
The bombardment began at 9.15 a.m., and the first shell
sank in a sand-heap, and forgot to explode. The second
and third fell short, but not very short. Then came shell
after shell, falling into street or backyard, and exploding
with a bang. Numbers rushed to find out what damage
had been done. Then grins stole across surprised faces:
the area of damage was about 3 square feet. Three
shells fell into the hospital, luckily doing no harm to anyone.
After some hours of terrible, thundering cannon-fire,
it suddenly ceased. The garrison counted up their
casualties. Three buildings had been struck&mdash;the hos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>pital,
the monastery, and Riesle’s Hotel; one life had been
taken&mdash;it was a pullet that had never yet laid an egg!</p>

<p class="header">The Boers, taken by surprise, were unsteady and panic-struck</p>

<p>An incident during the siege of Mafeking, when the British had sapped their way to within eighty yards of the Boer position.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Shortly after this bill of butchery had been presented
the Boer General sent an emissary to Colonel Baden-Powell.</p>

<p>“Commandant Snyman presents his compliments, and
desires to know if, to save further bloodshed, the English
would now surrender.”</p>

<p>Baden-Powell is a great actor; he never smiled as he
replied:</p>

<p>“Tell the Commandant, with my compliments, that we
have not yet begun.”</p>

<p>But a few days later the Boers were seen to be very
active on the veldt about three miles from the town, and
the rumour spread that they had sent to Pretoria for siege
guns. The townsfolk stood in groups and discussed the
new peril.</p>

<p>About noon next day the red flag flew from head-quarters.
Presently a great cloud of smoke rose on the
skyline; then came a rush of air, a roar as of some great
bird flying, a terrific concussion, and then flying fragments
of steel buried themselves in distant buildings, creating
a sense of terror throughout the town.</p>

<p>“Mafeking is doomed!” was the general cry that afternoon;
those alone who had dug themselves deep pits were
fairly comfortable in their minds. The second shot of
the big Creusot gun wrecked the rear of the Mafeking
Hotel, and the force of the explosion hurled the war
correspondent of the <i>Chronicle</i> upon a pile of wood.
Next day more than 200 shells were thrown into Mafeking,
which was saved by its mud walls; where bricks
would have been shattered and shaken, these walls only
threw out a cloud of dust.</p>

<p>As the Boers began to construct trenches round the city,
Captain Fitzclarence was ordered to make a midnight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
sortie. Shortly after eleven o’clock the little party started
on their perilous expedition; they crept on over the
veldt in extended order, noiseless as possible, nearer
and nearer to the Boer entrenchments. Those who
watched them felt the weirdness of the scene&mdash;the deep
silence, the mysterious noises of the veldt, the shadows
caused by the bush. Now they were within a few yards;
as they fixed bayonets they rushed forward with a cheer.
Then figures showed in the Boer position; shots rang out,
horses neighed and stampeded in fright. The Boers,
taken by surprise, were unsteady and panic-struck; not
many in the first trenches resisted long and stubbornly.
Captain Fitzclarence, a splendid swordsman, laid four
Boers who faced him on the ground; his men pursued with
the bayonet.</p>

<p>Botha said next day that they thought a thousand men
had been hurled against them, and the Boers in the other
trenches fired as fast as they could at anything they could
see or not see, many of the bullets going as far as the town.</p>

<p>This useless firing went on for a long time. When the
attacking party arrived at the town again, they found
they had lost only six men, eleven wounded, and two
taken prisoners. Next day the Boers fired no gun until
evening, and had plenty to do in collecting their wounded.</p>

<p>Several such night attacks were made in order to check
the Boers’ advance. After six weeks of siege, Colonel
Baden-Powell said in a published order: “Provisions are
not yet scarce, danger is purely incidental, and everything
in the garden is lovely.” He was always trying to cheer
up his little garrison with humorous speeches and funny
doings, with concerts and dances and theatrical entertainments.
It was the knowledge of what he had done
to keep up the spirits of his men and the spirits of Englishmen
at home which caused such a frenzy of delight when
Mafeking was finally relieved. What seemed a madness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
of joy was a sure instinct in the nation. It is true that
Mafeking, through the foresight of Julius Weil, the contractor,
possessed immense stocks of food; but as to its
defences, dummy camps and dummy earthworks built to
affright the Boers would not have availed unless the
loyalty and bravery of the colonists had been equal to
the severest strain. There was a wild desire to spike “Big
Ben,” but the Creusot was hedged round by barbed wire,
guarded by mines, and flanked by Nordenfeldt guns. It
seemed wearisome work, week after week, to find the
Boers standing away four or five miles, while from their
places of safety they launched their shells. Sometimes
in the night Baden-Powell would go forth alone, and creep
or stand and examine and ferret out the plans of the
enemy. Often, as he returned, he would startle some
dozing sentry, even as the great Napoleon, who once
found a sentry asleep, and shouldered his musket until
the fellow awoke with a start. “I will not tell, but don’t
do it again!”</p>

<p>Seven weary weeks have passed, and Mafeking still
endures the straits of a siege and the terrors of a bombardment.
The Boers have summoned to their aid the
finest guns from their arsenal in Pretoria to breach and
pound the earthworks; they pour shot and shell into the
little town: but everybody is living below ground now.</p>

<p>But they have bethought them of a new engine of terror
and death. All was dark outside, the good folk in Mafeking
were going to bed in peace, when a deafening roar
shook the town to its foundation of rock; a lurid glow of
blood-red fire lit up square and street and veldt, while
pattering down on roofs of corrugated iron dropped a
hailstorm of sand and stones, and twigs broken from
many trees. The frightened folk ran out to see what had
happened, and they saw a huge column of fire and smoke
rising from the ground to the north of Mafeking. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
the great roar of explosion came a weird silence and then
the rattle of falling fragments on roof after roof; and
then the cry of terror, the shriek of those who had been
aroused from sleep to face the great trumpet-call of the
Day of Judgment: for this they imagined that awful
phenomenon to portend.</p>

<p>It was not until the morning that they knew what had
caused the alarm. About half a mile up the line the
ground was rent and torn; the rails were bent and scattered
and flung about as by an earthquake.</p>

<p>On inquiry, they found that the Boers had filled a trolley
with dynamite, and were to impel it forwards towards
Mafeking. They lit the time-fuse, and proceeded to push
the trolley up a slight incline. A few yards further, and
it would reach the down incline, and would run merrily
into town without need of further aid from muscle of man.</p>

<p>But they gave over pushing a little too soon; the trolley
began to run back, and it was so dark they did not realize
it until it had gathered way; then they called to one
another, and some pushed, but others remembered the
time-fuse, and stood aloof with their mouths open.</p>

<p>Very soon the time-fuse met the charge, and the dynamite
hastened to work all the evil it could, regardless of
friend or foe.</p>

<p>Piet Cronje was in command of the Boers now; he was
vexed by this unlucky accident, but threatened to send
to Pretoria for dynamite guns, just to make this absurd
veldt-city jump and squeal. Cronje was willing to ride up
and storm Mafeking, but the idle braggarts who formed
the greater part of his army dared not face the steel;
yet there was more than one lady in the trenches able
and ready to use her rifle. The natives had suffered
more from shell-fire than the whites. It is not easy to
impress the Kaffir mind with the peril of a bursting shell;
though the Kaffir may have helped to build bomb-proof<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
shelters for Europeans, yet for himself and his family he
thinks a dug-out pit too costly, and will lie about under a
tarpaulin or behind a wooden box, until the inevitable
explosion some day sends him and his family into the air
in fragments.</p>

<p>One such victim was heard to murmur feebly as they put
him on the stretcher, “Boss, boss, me hurt very.” They
bear pain very stoically, and turn their brown pathetic
eyes on those who come to help them, much as a faithful
hound will look in his master’s face for sympathy when
in the agony of death. There were so many shells that
missed human life that the people grew careless and
ventured out too often.</p>

<p>Late in November a local wheelwright thought he would
extract the charge from a Boer shell which had not exploded.
The good man used a steel drill. For a time all
went well, and his two companions bent over to watch
the operation; then came a hideous row, a smell, a
smoke, and the wheelwright, with both his comrades, was
hurled into space.</p>

<p>The Boers had not spared the hospital or the convent.
The poor Sisters had had a fearful time; the children’s
dormitory was in ruins, and their home riddled with holes.
Still the brave Sisters stuck to their post, comforted the
dying, nursed the sick, and set an example of holy heroism.
Here is an extract from a letter describing a scene with the
Kaffirs:</p>

<p>“It is amusing to take a walk into the stadt, the place
of rocks, and watch the humours of the Kaffirs, some
8,000 in number. Now and then they hold a meeting,
when their attire is a funny mixture of savagery and semi-civilization.
You come upon a man wearing a fine pair
of check trousers, and nothing else, but mighty proud of
his check; another will wear nothing but a coat, with the
sleeves tied round his neck; some wear hats adorned with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
an ostrich feather, and a small loin-cloth. My black
friend was such a swell among them that he wore one of
my waistcoats, a loin-cloth, and a pair of tennis shoes.
He wore the waistcoat in order to disport a silver chain,
to which was attached an old watch that refused to go.
But it was a very valuable ornament to Setsedi, and won
him great influence in the kraal. Yet when my friend
Setsedi wanted to know the time of day, if he was alone,
he just glanced at the shadow of a tree; or if in company,
he lugged out his non-ticker, and made believe to consult
it in conjunction with the sun. The sun might be wrong&mdash;that
was the impression he wished to create&mdash;and it was
perhaps more prudent to correct solar time by this relic
of Ludgate Circus. Thus Setsedi, like other prominent
politicians, did not disdain to play upon the credulity of
his compatriots.</p>

<p>“Sometimes on a Sunday afternoon, when the Boers
were keeping the Sabbath and no shells were flying
around, the children of the veldt would begin a dance.
They formed into groups of forty or fifty, and began with
hand-clapping, jumping, and stamping of bare feet. The
old crones came capering round, grinning and shrieking
delight in high voices apt to crack for age. From stamping
the young girls passed on to swaying bodies, every
limb vibrating with rising emotion, as they flung out
sinewy arms with languorous movement; then more wild
grew the dance, more loud the cries of the dancers, as they
threw themselves into striking postures, glided, shifted,
retreated, laughed, or cried.</p>

<p>“I had been watching them for some time when Setsedi
came up to me and said:</p>

<p>“‘Baas, I go now to mark some cows for to-night;
will you come?’</p>

<p>“‘What! has the big white chief given you leave to
make a raid?’ I asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Yes, Marenna&mdash;yes; we are to go out to-night, and
bring in a herd from beyond the brickfields yonder&mdash;if
we can.’</p>

<p>“‘And you go now, this afternoon, to mark them down,
and spy out the ground?’</p>

<p>“He smiled, showing a set of splendid teeth, pulled out
his watch, hit it back and front with his knuckles till it
rattled to the very centre of the works, spat carefully,
and replied with some pride:</p>

<p>“‘We brought in twenty oxen last week; the chief
very pleased with us, and gave us a nice share, Marenna.’</p>

<p>“Setsedi addressed me thus when he was pleased with
himself and the universe: Marenna means sir.</p>

<p>“‘Well, Setsedi,’ said I, ‘if I can get leave, I would
like to go out with you to-night. May I bring my boy,
Malasata?’</p>

<p>“The idea of my asking his permission gave Setsedi
such a lift up in his own opinion of himself that he actually
reflected with his chin in the air before he finally gave
his royal assent to my proposition.</p>

<p>“Time and place were settled, and I went back to the
club for a wash. These black chaps, if they don’t help
us much in fighting, have proved themselves very useful
in providing us now and then with rich, juicy beef from
the Boer herds that stray about the veldt. When I went
home and told Malasata he was to accompany me to-night
on a cattle-raiding foray, like a true Kaffir, he concealed
his delight, and only said, ‘Ā-hă, Ā-hă, Unkos!’ but he
could not prevent his great brown eyes from sparkling
with pleasure. When it was pitch-dark we started&mdash;about
a score of us&mdash;and crept along silently past the
outposts, word having been passed that the raiders were
to go and come with a Kaffir password or countersign.</p>

<p>“Most of the Kaffirs were stark naked, the better to
evade the grasp of any Boer who might clutch at them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
A sergeant had been told off to accompany them; he and
I were the only white men out that night. After an
hour’s careful climbing and crawling, stopping to listen
and feel the wind, the better to gauge our direction,
Setsedi came close to my ear and whispered:</p>

<p>“‘We can smell them, Baas; plenty good smell. You
and sergeant stay here; sit down, wait a bit; boots too
much hullabaloo; too loud talkee!’</p>

<p>“It was disappointing, but we quite saw the need of this
caution, and we neither of us saw the necessity of walking
barefoot upon a stony veldt; so we sat down in the black
silence, and waited. Yet it was not so silent as it seemed:
we could hear the bull-frogs croaking a mile away in the
river-bed, and sometimes a distant tinkle of a cow-bell
came to us on the soft breeze, or a meercat rustled in
the grass after a partridge. In about half an hour we
heard something; was it a reed-buck? Then came the
falling of a stone, the crackling of a stick as it broke under
their tread; then we rose and walked towards our black
friends.</p>

<p>“Three or four Kaffirs were shepherding each ox,
‘getting a move’ on him by persuasion or fist-law. Sometimes
one ox would be restive and ‘moo’ to his mates,
or gallop wildly hither and thither; but always the persistent,
ubiquitous Kaffir kept in touch with his beast,
talking to him softly like a man and a brother, and guiding
him the way he should go. And all this time the Boers
were snoring not 300 yards off, sentry and all, very
probably. But it would not do to count upon their
negligence; any indiscreet noise might awake a trenchful
of Mauser-armed men, and bring upon us a volley of death.</p>

<p>“When we had got the cattle well out of earshot of
the Boer lines, the Kaffirs urged on the oxen by running
up and pinching them, but without uttering a sound. As
we drew near to the native stadt, a great number of natives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
who had been lying concealed in the veldt rose up to
help their friends drive the raided cattle into the enclosure,
and the sergeant went to head-quarters with
the report of twenty-four head of cattle safely housed.”</p>

<p>The besieged had persevered in their “dug-outs” until
May, 1900, being weary and sometimes sick, faint with
poor food, and hopes blighted. They had been asked by
Lord Roberts to endure a little longer; Kimberley had
been relieved, and their turn would come soon.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, President Kruger’s nephew, Commandant
Eloff, had come into the Boer camp with men who had
once served as troopers at Mafeking, and who knew much
about the fortifications. Eloff made a skilful attack upon
the town on the 12th of May, and was successful in capturing
a fort, Colonel Hore, and twenty-three men. This attack
had been urgent, because news had reached the Boers that
the British relief column had reached Vryburg on the 10th
of May, and Vryburg is only ninety-six miles south of Mafeking.
During the fight Mr. J. A. Hamilton, not knowing
that the fort had been taken, thought that he would ride
across to see Colonel Hore. It was a short ride from
where he was&mdash;only a few hundred yards. The bullets
whistled near his head, and he scampered across the open
to reach cover. It was a bad light, and smoke was
drifting about, but he saw men standing about the head-quarters
or sitting on the stoep facing the town. As he
rode his horse was struck, and swerved violently; some
one seized his bridle and shouted “Surrender!” They
were Boers, and amongst them were Germans, Italians,
and Frenchmen. Many speaking at once, they ordered him
to hold up his hands, give up his revolver, get off his horse.</p>

<p>“We had better all take cover, I think,” said Hamilton,
as English bullets were falling rather near them.</p>

<p>Then they took him within the walls. But he had not
yet obeyed any of their orders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span></p>

<p>“Will you hold your hands up?” said one Boer, thrusting
a rifle into his ribs with a grin.</p>

<p>“With pleasure, under the circumstances,” he replied,
trying to smile.</p>

<p>“Will you kindly hand over that revolver?” said
another.</p>

<p>“What! and hold my hands up at the same time?”</p>

<p>They were dull; they did not see the joke, but shouted,
“Get off!”</p>

<p>Some one unstrapped the girths, and Mr. Hamilton
rolled to the ground. It was only then that he saw his
horse had been shot in the shoulder, and he asked them
to put the poor beast out of his pain.</p>

<p>“No, no! Your men will do that soon enough,” said
they.</p>

<p>The poor animal stood quietly looking at him, as he
says, with a sad, pathetic, inquiring look in his eyes, as if
he were asking, “What can you do for me? I assure you
my shoulder gives me awful pain.”</p>

<p>Hamilton was taken inside the fort and made prisoner.
When, later in the day, he came out, he found his poor
horse lying with his throat cut and seven bullet-wounds
in his body.</p>

<p>There were thirty-three prisoners crowded in a small,
ill-ventilated store-room, and they grew very hungry.
As dusk settled down they began to hear echoes of desperate
fighting outside. Bullets came through the wall
and roofing, splintering window and door; through the
grating of the windows they could see limping figures
scurry and scramble; they heard voices cursing them and
urging Eloff to handcuff and march the prisoners across
the line of fire as a screen for them in their retreat. Then
the firing died down, and the Boers seemed to have rallied;
then came a fresh outburst of heavy firing, and then a
sudden silence. Eloff rushed to the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where is Colonel Hore?”</p>

<p>“Here!”</p>

<p>“Sir, if you can induce the town to cease fire, we will
surrender.”</p>

<p>It was quite unexpected, this turn of events. No one
spoke. Then Eloff said:</p>

<p>“I give myself up as a hostage. Get them to cease fire.”</p>

<p>The prisoners went out, waved handkerchiefs, shouted,
“Surrender! Cease fire, boys.”</p>

<p>When this was done sixty-seven Boers laid down their
rifles, and the prisoners stacked them up in their late
prison.</p>

<p>Commandant Eloff was now a prisoner instead of
being master of Mafeking; his partial success he owed
to his own dash and gallantry, his failure to the half-hearted
support of General Snyman. He dined at head-quarters,
and a bottle of champagne was opened to
console him and distinguish this day of surprises.</p>

<p>On the 16th of May there was great excitement in the
town; the great activity in the Boer laagers, the clouds
of dust rising in the south, all showed that something
new and strange was coming. News had come of General
Mahon having joined Colonel Plumer a few miles up
the river. “When will they come?” everybody was
asking. About half-past two General Mahon’s guns were
heard, and the smoke of the bursting shells could be seen
in the north-west.</p>

<p>In the town people were taking things very calmly.
Had they not enjoyed this siege now for seven months,
when it had been expected to last three weeks at the
most? They were playing off the final match in the
billiard tournament at the club. Then came a hubbub,
and Major Pansera galloped by with the guns to get a
parting shot at the retiring Boers.</p>

<p>Then fell the dusk, and the guns came back. Every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>body
went to dinner very elated and happy. “By noon
to-morrow we shall be relieved,” they said.</p>

<p>It was now about seven o’clock; the moon was shining
brightly in the square.</p>

<p>“Hello! what’s this? Who are you, then?”</p>

<p>There were eight mounted men sitting on horseback
outside the head-quarters office.</p>

<p>“Who are you, and what do you want?” asked a man
in the crowd.</p>

<p>“We are under Major Karie Davis with a despatch
from General Mahon.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>“Yes, we’ve come to relieve you fellows; but you
don’t seem to care much whether you are relieved or
not.”</p>

<p>Then the news travelled round the town; a great
crowd gathered, and round after round of cheers broke
out. The troopers were surrounded by enthusiastic citizens,
cross-questioned, congratulated, slapped on the
back, shaken by the hand, and offered&mdash;coffee!</p>

<p>Major Davis came out and called for cheers for the
garrison; then all fell to hallooing of such anthems as
“Rule Britannia” and “God save the Queen.”</p>

<p>Then the troopers of the Imperial Light Horse were
taken in to supper.</p>

<p>About two in the morning the troops entered Mafeking&mdash;not
quite 2,000 men; but when the townsfolk, hearing
the noise, ran out into the starry, moonlit night, they
saw such a host of horses, mules, and bullocks, such a
line of waggons and camp-followers, and such a beautiful
battery of bright Royal Horse and Canadian Artillery and
Maxims that life seemed worth living at last. Those who
did not laugh quietly went home and cried for joy. They
had earned their day of delight.</p>

<p>Mafeking had endured 1,498 shells from the 100-pound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
Creusot; besides this, they had had to dodge 21,000 odd
shells of smaller calibre. Men who saw Ladysmith said
that the ruin at Mafeking was far greater.</p>

<p>Lord Roberts had, with his wonted generosity, sent a
mob of prime bullocks and a convoy of other luxuries.
So when the Queen’s birthday came, as it soon did, the
town made merry and were very thankful.</p>

<p>England was thankful too, for although it was only a
little town on the veldt, every eye at home had been upon
the brave defenders who, out of so little material, had
produced so grand a defence.</p>

<p>It is not too much to say that Colonel Baden-Powell
and his gallant company had not only kept the flag
flying; they had done far more: they had kept up the
spirits of a nation beginning to be humiliated by defeat
after defeat, when most of the nations of Europe were
jeering at her, and wishing for her downfall. But God
gave us victory in the end.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</a><br />
<span class="smaller">THE SIEGE OF KIMBERLEY (1899-1900)</span></h2>

<p class="summary">The diamond-mines&mdash;Cecil Rhodes comes in&mdash;Streets barricaded&mdash;Colonel
Kekewich sends out the armoured train&mdash;Water got from
the De Beers Company’s mines&mdash;A job lot of shells&mdash;De Beers can
make shells too&mdash;Milner’s message&mdash;Beef or horse?&mdash;Long Cecil&mdash;Labram
killed&mdash;Shelter down the mines&mdash;A capture of dainties&mdash;Major
Rodger’s adventures&mdash;General French comes to the rescue&mdash;Outposts
astonished to see Lancers and New Zealanders.</p>

<p>Kimberley is the second largest town in Cape Colony,
and is the great diamond-mining district, having a
population of about 25,000 whites. Mr. Cecil Rhodes
was the Chairman of the De Beers Mines Company,
which pays over a million a year in wages.</p>

<p>Kimberley could not at first believe war to be possible
between the Dutch and English, though they saw the
regular troops putting up earthworks and loopholed
forts all round the town. Next a Town Guard was
formed to man the forts, while the 600 regulars and
artillery were to be camped in a central position ready
for emergencies. Cecil Rhodes arrived the last day the
railway was open, and began at once to raise a regiment
at his own expense&mdash;the Kimberley Light Horse. All
the streets were blocked with barricades and barbed
wires to prevent the Boers rushing in. The main streets
had a narrow opening left in the centre guarded by
volunteers, who had orders to let none pass without a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
signed permit. Rhodes used to ride far out on the veldt,
dressed in white flannel trousers, though the Boers hated
him, and would dearly have liked to pot him at a safe
distance.</p>

<p>Colonel Kekewich was in command&mdash;a man of Devon,
and very popular with his men. On the 24th of
October they had their first taste of fighting, when a
patrol came across a force of Boers who were out with
the object of raiding the De Beers’ cattle. Kekewich,
from his conning-tower, could see his men in difficulties,
and sent out the armoured train, and the Boers were
speedily dispersed. There were many wounded on both
sides, and the Mauser bullet was found to be able to
drill a neat hole through bone and muscle, in some cases
without doing so much damage as the old bullets of
lower velocity in earlier wars.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the siege it was feared that water
might fail, but in three weeks the De Beers Company had
contrived to supply the town with water from an underground
stream in one of their mines.</p>

<p>The bombardment began on the 7th of November,
and, as at Mafeking, did not do much damage, for the
shells, being fired from Spytfontein, four miles away,
and being a “job lot” supplied to the Transvaal
Government, did not often reach the houses, and often
forgot to burst. So that, it is said, an Irish policeman,
hearing a shell explode in the street near him, remarked
calmly to himself: “The blazes! and what will they be
playing at next?”</p>

<p>But by the 11th the Boers had brought their guns
nearer, had found the range, and were becoming a
positive nuisance to quiet citizens.</p>

<p>Sunday was a day of rest and no shelling took place,
but on other days it began at daylight, and, with pauses
for meals and a siesta, continued till nine or ten o’clock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
at night. As usual, there were extraordinary escapes.
One shell just missed the dining-room of the Queen’s
Hotel, where a large company were at dinner, and,
choosing the pantry close beside it, killed two cats.
Luckily there was time between the sound of the gun and
the arrival of the shell to get into cover.</p>

<p>The De Beers Company, having many clever engineers
and artisans, soon began to make their own shells, which
had “With C. J. R.’s Compts.” stamped upon them&mdash;rather
a grim jest when they did arrive.</p>

<p>On the 28th November Colonel Scott Turner, who
commanded the mounted men, was killed in a sortie.
He was a very brave, but rather reckless, officer, and was
shot dead close to the Boer fort.</p>

<p>Sometimes our own men would go out alone, spying
and sniping, and in many cases they were shot by their
own comrades by mistake.</p>

<p>By December the milk-farms outside the town had
been looted, and fresh milk began to be very scarce; even
tinned milk could not be bought without a doctor’s order,
countersigned by the military officer who was in charge
of the stores. The result was that many young children
died.</p>

<p>At Christmas Sir Alfred Milner sent a message to
Kimberley, wishing them a <i>lucky</i> Christmas. This gave
the garrison matter for thought, and the townsfolk
wondered if England had forgotten their existence.</p>

<p>Those who could spent some time and care on their
gardens, for they tried to find a nice change from wurzels
to beet, and even beans and lettuce. For scurvy, the
consequence of eating too much meat without green
stuff, had already threatened the town. Those who
wanted food had to go to the market hall and fetch it,
showing a ticket which mentioned how many persons
were to be supplied. When horse-flesh first began to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
used by the officers, Colonel Peakman, presiding at mess,
said cheerfully: “Gentlemen, very sorry we can’t supply
you all with beef to-day. Beef this end, very nice joint
of horse the other end. Please try it.” But the officers
all applied for beef, as the Colonel had feared they would.</p>

<p>Then suddenly, when all had finished, he banged his
hand on the table, and said: “By Jove! I see I have
made a mistake in the joints. This is the capital joint
of horse which I am carving! Dear! dear! I wanted
so to taste the horse, but&mdash;what! not so bad after all?
Then you will forgive me, I am sure, for being so stupid.”</p>

<p>All the same, some of them thought that the Colonel
had made the mistake on purpose, just to get them past
the barrier of prejudice.</p>

<p>Towards the end of January the bombardment grew
more severe; the shells came from many quarters, and
some were shrapnel, which caused many wounds. The
new gun made by the De Beers Company did its best to
reply, but it was only one against eight or nine. The
Boers confessed that they directed their fire to the
centre of the town, where there were mostly only women
and children, for the men were away from home in the
forts or behind the earthworks. The townsfolk tried
to improve their shell-proof places, but most of them
were deadly holes, hot and stuffy beyond description,
but that made by Mr. Rhodes around the Public Gardens
was far superior to the rest. The De Beers gun was named
“Long Cecil,” after Mr. Rhodes, and was about 10 feet
long; it threw a shell weighing 28 pounds. When it was
first fired, the great question was, “Will it burst?”</p>

<p>But the Boers were surprised, when they sat at breakfast
in a safe spot, to hear shells dropping around like
ripe apples. That breakfast was left unfinished, as an
intercepted letter informed the garrison.</p>

<p>However, the Boers soon placed a bigger gun near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
Kimberley, and shells began to fall in the market-place
very freely.</p>

<p>In February the garrison had a great loss. The last
shell of that day fell into the Grand Hotel and killed
George Labram, the De Beers chief engineer. It was
Labram who had arranged for the new water-supply,
who had made the new shells, and planned “Long Cecil.”
He was to Kimberley what Kondrachenko was to the
Russians at Port Arthur&mdash;a man of many inventions, an
American, ready at all points. He had just gone upstairs
to wash before dinner, when a shell entered and cut him
to ribbons, so that he died instantly. A servant of the
hotel was in his room at the time, and was not touched.</p>

<p>Towards the middle of February notices signed by Cecil
Rhodes were posted up all over the town to the effect
that women and children should take shelter in the two
big mines. So very soon the streets were full of people
running to the mines with babies, blankets, bread, and
bedding. The crowd was so great that it took from
5.30 p.m. to midnight to lower them all down the shafts.
Kimberley mine took more than 1,000, the De Beers
mine 1,500, and all were lowered without a single accident.</p>

<p>One day some natives came in with a story that the
Boers had deserted the fort Alexandersfontein. Spies
were sent out to investigate, and reported it to be a fact,
so some of the Town Guard, with help from the Lancashires,
sallied out and took possession of the fort. A
few Boers who had been left there were wounded or taken
prisoners.</p>

<p>“We will wait a bit in this fort, boys, to see what
will turn up,” said the Captain; and in a short time
they saw four waggons coming up, which were driven
unsuspiciously right into his hands. Other waggons
followed, all full of most delicious dainties for Boer
stomachs, but likely to be received in starving Kimberley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
with greater enthusiasm&mdash;such things as poultry, grain,
butter, fresh vegetables, and bacon. The waggons were
drawn by fat bullocks&mdash;a sight for mirth and jollity.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the poor Boers knew what they had
missed, and some very spiteful bullets were sent across
for several hours.</p>

<p>Major Rodger had sent some men to spy out the
country, and was waiting for their return. Presently
he saw two men advancing towards him, and thinking
they were his own men he rode up to them. On drawing
near he saw they were Boers. His main body of men were
far behind, and he realized that if he galloped away he
would be shot, so he quietly walked his horse up to them.
One of the Boers said: “Who are you?” “Only one
of the fighting-men from Kimberley,” the Major replied.
They did not draw their revolvers, they did not cry
“Hands up!” and seize him by the collar&mdash;no, all they
did was to utter a brief swear, turn their horses’ heads,
and scamper over the veldt as fast as they could, stooping
over the pommel to avoid the Major’s fire. But half a
mile away they hit upon some of their own comrades,
fired a few volleys, broke the Major’s arm, and retired.</p>

<p>Major Rodger, however, had not done his day’s work,
and never told his men he had been shot until they
returned to Kimberley in the evening. So much for a
Kimberley volunteer!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the little folks and the women deep down
in the mine&mdash;some 1,500 feet&mdash;were busy devouring
sandwiches of corned-beef and horse, and buckets of
tea and coffee, with condensed milk, were lowered down
too. The large chamber cut out of the rock was lit with
electric light, and was not very hot, though it was
crammed with children, many of whom were lying on
rugs or blankets; they lay so thick on the floor that
walking amongst them was the feat of an acrobat. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
they were safe down there! No ghastly sights of mangled
limbs met their gaze, no whizz of deadly shell, no scream
of pain reached them there. It was worth something to
have escaped the horrors of a siege, and to feel no nervous
tremors, no cowardly panic, no dull despair.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Lord Roberts had not forgotten Kimberley.
A force of some 5,000 sabres, led by General French, with
two batteries of Horse Artillery, had galloped in the
dead of night to the Modder River. Here a small Boer
force fled from before them, and ever on through the
quivering heat rode Hussars, Dragoons, and Lancers,
until both men and horses fell out exhausted on the veldt.
On the third day they came close to some kopjes, or hills,
on which Boers were posted, who stared in amazement at
the sight of the 9th Lancers sweeping in open order
round the base of the hills. A hundred miles they had
ridden with scant food and scanter water, so that the
Boers might have been still more surprised to see many a
trooper walking by his tired steed, and even carrying the
saddle.</p>

<p>Dr. Conan Doyle tells us that “a skirmish was in progress
on the 15th of February between a party of the
Kimberley Light Horse and some Boers, when a new
body of horsemen, unrecognized by either side, appeared
upon the plain, and opened fire upon the enemy. One
of the strangers rode up to the Kimberley patrol, and
said:</p>

<p>“‘What the dickens does K.L.H. mean on your
shoulder-strap?’</p>

<p>“‘It means Kimberley Light Horse. Who are you?’</p>

<p>“‘I am one of the New Zealanders.’”</p>

<p>How puzzled that member of the Kimberley force
must have been&mdash;a New Zealander out on the African
veldt!</p>

<p>Soon the little clouds of dust on the horizon drew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
hundreds of townsfolk to the earthworks, and as the
glint of spear-head and scabbard flashed out of the
cloud, and the besieged garrison knew their troubles were
over, men waved their hats and shouted, and tearful,
laughing ladies flocked round the first men who rode in,
and nearly pulled them out of the saddle. Then they
set to and hauled the rest out of the mines, finishing
that job well by midnight.</p>

<p>For 124 days Kimberley had been besieged. The Boers
had never once attacked the town, though not more than
550 mounted men were latterly available for offensive
work; these, with the Town Guard, Lancashires, and
Kimberley Rifles, made a total of 3,764. Colonel
Kekewich might well look radiantly happy; he had
administered everything with strict justice, and had
earned the respect and admiration of all, while Cecil
Rhodes and the De Beers officials had magnificently met
and countered every difficulty with generous skill and
unflagging energy.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV</a><br />
<span class="smaller">THE SIEGE OF LADYSMITH (1899-1900)</span></h2>

<p class="summary">Ladysmith&mdash;Humours of the shell&mdash;The <i>Lyre</i> tries to be funny&mdash;Attack
on Long Tom&mdash;A brave bugler&mdash;Practical jokes&mdash;The black
postman&mdash;A big trek&mdash;Last shots&mdash;Some one comes&mdash;Saved at last.</p>

<p>Ladysmith, where Sir George White and his men detained
the Boers so long, is a scattered town lying on a lake-like
plain, and surrounded by an amphitheatre of rocky
hills. To the north-west was Pepworth Hill, where
the Boer Long Tom was placed; north-east of the town,
and four miles away, was Unbulwana: here the Boers
had dragged a large siege-gun.</p>

<p>South of the town the Klip River runs close under
the hills, and here many caves were dug as hiding-places
for the residents. There were many women and children
there all day long. On the 3rd of November the wires
were cut; Ladysmith was isolated and besieged. On
the next day it was discussed whether General Joubert’s
proposal should be accepted&mdash;that the civilians, women,
and children should go out and form a camp five miles
off under the white flag. Archdeacon Barker got up, and
said: “Our women and children shall stay with the men
under the Union Jack, and those who would do them
harm may come to them at their peril.”</p>

<p>The meeting cheered the tall, white-haired priest, and
agreed thereto.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span></p>

<p>The townsfolk soon got used to shell-fire, but they
spent most of the day by the river in their cool caves.
There was a Dr. Starke, a visitor from Torquay, who
used to go about with a fishing-rod, and spend hours by
the river&mdash;a kindly man, who one day found a cat mewing
piteously at a deserted house, and, making friends with
it, used to carry it about with him. This gentleman,
having the cat in his arms, was standing near the door
of the Royal Hotel talking to Mr. McHugh, when a shell
came through the roof, passed through two bedrooms,
and whizzed out at the front-door, catching the poor
doctor just above the knees. His friend escaped without
a scratch. Dr. Starke had always tried to avoid the
peril of shells, and they used to banter him on his over-anxiety.
It is strange how many hits and how many
misses are in the nature of a surprise.</p>

<p>Late in November a shell entered a room in which a
little child was sleeping, and knocked one of the walls
of the bedroom clean out. In the cloud of dust and
smoke the parents heard the cry of the little babe,
rushed in, and found her absolutely untouched, while
20 yards away a splinter of the same shell killed a man
of the Natal Police. At the same house later in the
evening two friends called to congratulate the mother;
they were being shown two pet rabbits, when a splinter
of a shell came in and cut in two one of the rabbits.</p>

<p>One day a Natal Mounted Rifleman was lying in his
tent, stretched himself, yawned, and turned over. At
that instant a shell struck the spot where he had just
been lying, made a hole in the ground, and burst. The
tent was blown away from its ropes, his pillow and
clothes were tossed into the air. Poor fellow! his comrades
ran towards him, and found him sitting up, pale,
but unharmed. They could hardly believe their senses.
“Why, man, you ought to have been blown to smithe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>reens!”
Another day a trooper of the 18th Hussars
was rolled over, horse and all, yet neither of them suffered
any severe injury.</p>

<p>December came, and by then the poor women were
looking harassed and worn: so many grievous sights,
so many perils to try and avoid, so many losses to weep
over.</p>

<p>Some of the correspondents brought out a local paper,
the <i>Ladysmith Lyre</i>, to enliven the spirits of the dull and
timid and sick. The news may be sampled by the
following extracts:</p>

<p>“<i>November 14.</i>&mdash;General French has twice been seen
in Ladysmith disguised as a Kaffir. His force is entrenched
behind Bulwen. Hurrah!</p>

<p>“<i>November 20.</i>&mdash;H.M.S. <i>Powerful</i> ran aground in
attempting to come up Klip River; feared total loss.
[Klip River is 2 feet deep in parts.]</p>

<p>“<i>November 21.</i>&mdash;We hear on good authority that the
gunner of Long Tom is Dreyfus.</p>

<p>“<i>November 26.</i>&mdash;Boers broke Sabbath firing on our
bathing parties. Believed so infuriated by sight of
people washing that they quite forgot it was Sunday.”</p>

<p>The <i>Ladysmith Lyre</i> had come out three times before
December.</p>

<p>On the 7th of December, at 10 p.m., 400 men, who had
volunteered for the task, were ordered to turn out, carrying
rifles and revolvers only, and to make no noise. A
small party of Engineers were to be with them. Their
object was to destroy Long Tom, which was now removed
from Pepworth to Lombard’s Kop, on the north-east. They
started when the moon went down on a fine starlight
night. By a quarter to two a.m. they were close to
the foot of Lombard’s Kop, but the Boer pickets had not
been alarmed. General Hunter, who led them, explained
how 100 of the Imperial Light Horse and 100 of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
Carbineers would steal up the mountain and take the
Boer guns, while 200 of the Border Mounted (on foot)
would go round the hill to protect their comrades from
a flank attack. The Engineers, carrying gun-cotton
and tools, followed close after the storming party. As
our men were creeping quietly up the hill on hands and
knees, amazed that there were no outposts, a sudden
challenge rang out behind them: “Wis kom dar?”</p>

<p>Had the Boer sentry been dreaming in the drowsy
night?</p>

<p>“Wis (pronounced ve) kom dar? Wis kom dar?” he
impatiently shouted. Our men sat down on the slope
above him, grinning to themselves, and made no answer.</p>

<p>“Wis kom dar?” He was getting angry and frightened
this time, by the tone of it.</p>

<p>“Take that fellow in the wind with the butt of a rifle,
and stop his mouth.”</p>

<p>Then the Boer knew who they were, and yelled to
his comrades for help; then they heard him say to his
after-rider: “Bring my peart&mdash;my horse!” and he was
safely off!</p>

<p>Further up the hill a shrill voice shouted: “Martinas,
Carl Joubert, der Rovinek!” (the Red-neck). At this our
men clambered up like goats, while a volley was fired,
and bullets whizzed over their heads.</p>

<p>“Stick to me, guides!” shouted General Hunter.</p>

<p>As they neared the top Colonel Edwards, of the volunteers,
shouted: “Now then, boys, fix bayonets, and
give them a taste of the steel.” This was meant for the
Dutchmen to hear, for there was not a bayonet amongst
the assaulting party.</p>

<p>The Boers do not like cold steel, and they were heard
slithering and stumbling down the other side of the
mountain. Now they were up on the top. There stood
Long Tom pointing at high heaven, loaded ready, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
laid to a range of 8,000 yards, or over four miles. Not
a Boer was to be seen or heard anywhere.</p>

<p>Quickly the Engineers got to work. Some removed
the breech-block, others filled the barrel with gun-cotton,
plugged both muzzle and breech, and ran a pretty necklace
of gun-cotton round the dainty ribs of the barrel.
Long Tom was looking quite unconscious of their attentions,
and shone in the starlight.</p>

<p>He had been set on solid masonry, was mounted on
high iron wheels, and a short railway line had been laid
down for purposes of locomotion. A thick bomb-proof
arch was built over him, and huge pyramids of shells
were piled up round about him. A Howitzer and a field-gun,
which stood close by, were then destroyed, and a
Maxim was reserved to be brought away.</p>

<p>In about twenty minutes the Engineers announced
that they were ready.</p>

<p>Like goats they had swarmed about him, and now it
was Long Tom’s turn to say “Baa!”</p>

<p>The firing fuse was attached. “Keep back! keep
back!”</p>

<p>There was heard a dull roar from the monster, and the
whole mountain flared out with a flash as if of lightning.</p>

<p>“Had the gun-cotton done its work?” They ran
back to inspect.</p>

<p>“Barrel rent, sir; part of the muzzle torn away.”
Long Tom has fired his last shot. The ladies of Ladysmith
will be very thankful for this small favour. The
men came back, most of them carrying small trophies.</p>

<p>Down they scrambled; no barbed wire, no impediments.
Who would have thought that these English
would stir out o’ night? Had they no desire to sleep
and rest? But when they got down they found some
had been wounded. Major Henderson had been twice
hit&mdash;thumb almost torn away, and a couple of slugs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
in his thigh. Yet he had never halted, and was the first
to tackle the gun. A few privates were also hit, but only
one so seriously as to be left behind in care of a surgeon.</p>

<p>Great rejoicing at breakfast, and congratulations from
Sir George White.</p>

<p>But the time wore on, and sickness came&mdash;far worse
and more fatal than shell-fire. There were hundreds of
fever patients in the hospital outside at Intombi Spruit.</p>

<p>Fever&mdash;typhoid, enteric&mdash;and no stimulants, no jellies,
no beef-tea!</p>

<p>The only luxury was a small ration of tinned milk.
Scores of convalescents died of sheer starvation. The
doctors were overworked, and they, too, broke down.</p>

<p>No wonder that many in the garrison chafed at inaction,
found fault with their superiors, and asked bitterly:
“Are we to stay here till we rot?”</p>

<p>By New Year’s Eve Ladysmith had endured some
8,000 rounds of shell; many buildings had been hit half
a dozen times. On New Year’s Day an officer of the
Lancers was sleeping in his house, when a shell exploded
and buried him in a heap of timber. When they pulled
the mess off him, he sat up, rubbed the dust out of
his eyes, and asked, “What o’clock is it?” He was
unhurt.</p>

<p>There was a small bugler of the 5th Lancers who was
the envy of every boy in the town. This boy was in the
battle at Elands Laagte, and when a regiment seemed
wavering he sounded the call, the advance, the charge.
The result was that that regiment faced the music, and
did valiantly. A General rode up to the bugler after the
fight, and took his name, saying: “You are a plucky
boy. I shall report you!”</p>

<p>For this boy, after sounding the charge, had drawn
his revolver, rode into the thick of the fight on his Colonel’s
flank, and shot three Boers one after the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span></p>

<p>Scores of officers gave the boy a sovereign for his
pluck, and he wore his cap all through the siege in a very
swagger fashion.</p>

<p>Some of the regiments had their pet dogs in Ladysmith.</p>

<p>When the King’s Royals went into action their regimental
dog went with them. He had never been out of
the fighting line, and had never had a scratch, but seemed
to enjoy the fun of barking and looking back, saying,
“Come on&mdash;faster!”</p>

<p>There was another, a little red mongrel, who insisted
on seeing every phase of warfare; he had lost a leg in
India&mdash;it was so smashed up that the doctor had to
cut it off. There he was, pottering about on three legs,
full of inquisitive ardour, and when not engaged on
sanitary inspection work, always to the front when the
guns were at it. This was the Hussars’ dog.</p>

<p>The Boers were fond of playing practical jokes. On
Christmas Day they had fired a shell containing a plum-pudding
into the artillery camp. On the hundred and first
day of the siege one of the Boers on Bulwana Hill called
up the signallers at Cæsar’s Camp, and flashed the
message, “A hundred and one, not out.”</p>

<p>The Manchesters flashed back: “Ladysmith still
batting.”</p>

<p>“What is the use of shelling these Britishers?” once
said a Boer artilleryman. “They just go on playing
cricket. Look yonder!”</p>

<p>Ah! but that was in the early days of the siege, when
they had some strength in them. Later, after having
short rations of horse-flesh, they could hardly creep from
hill to hill.</p>

<p>Another day a heliograph message came: “How do
you like horse-meat?”</p>

<p>“Fine,” was the answer, “When the horses are
finished we shall eat baked Boer!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span></p>

<p>It became very difficult to get letters through the
Boer pickets; they had so many ways of trapping the
native runners. The Kaffir paths were watched; bell-wires
were doubled&mdash;one placed close to the ground,
the other at the height of a man’s head. When the
Kaffir touched one of these an electric bell rang on one
of the kopjes, or hills, and swarms of guards swooped
down to intercept him. But the Kaffir, being paid
£15 a journey, did his best too.</p>

<p>He left the outer line of our pickets at dusk, and flitted
away silently to the nearest native kraal; he handed in
the letters to the black chief, and wandered on empty-handed
towards General Buller’s camp. Meanwhile a
simple Kaffir girl would pass the Boer camp, calabash
on head, going to fetch water from the spring in the
early morning. The letters were in the empty water-vessel!</p>

<p>She put them under a stone by the spring, and another
maiden would come from the other side, and take them
on in her calabash or mealie-jar.</p>

<p>At last the native runner would call for them and
carry the letters to the English lines.</p>

<p>On the 6th of January a determined attack was made
by the pick of the Boers upon Cæsar’s Camp. Our pickets
in Buller’s relieving army could hear the sound of the
guns, muffled by distance; officers and men gathered
in groups on the hill-sides and listened intently to the
long low growl of the rifle. Then came a helio message
from Sir George White to General Clery: “Attacked on
every side.” The nervous strain on these men, condemned
to inaction after each new failure to cross the
Tugela and fight their way into Ladysmith, became almost
insupportable. They sat outside the big camp, gazing
on Bulwana with telescopes and field-glasses, hardly
daring to utter their thoughts. A second helio was flashed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
across: “Enemy everywhere repulsed; fighting continues.”
Then tongues were once more loosened, and
hope arose as the distant firing sank to a sullen minute-gun.
But half an hour later the booming of big guns on
Bulwana was renewed, and away to the west arose a
fierce rifle fire. “Attack renewed; enemy reinforced,”
winked the helio from the top of Convent Hill, and again
a dumb despair fell on the watchers. “Very hard
pressed,” came the third message, firing our soldiers
with indignant rage, as they thought of the poor part
they had hitherto taken in relieving Ladysmith. But
at length the heroism of the Devons, the Imperial Light
Horse, and others of the Ladysmith garrison beat back
the Boers’ desperate assault.</p>

<p>The Devons had climbed up the hill late in the afternoon
to avenge their fallen comrades. They had charged
straight up the hill in a line, but a deadly fire at short
range brought down dozens of them as they rushed the
top. However, there was no wavering in the Devons,
but they pressed forward at the double with the steel
advanced, and only a few Boers waited for that disagreeable
operation in war. There was a terrific hailstorm
going on as Colonel Park halted his men just
below the crest: it was a moment to try the nerves of
the strongest. Once over that lip of hillside and a fiercer
storm than hail would meet them in the face, and call
many of them to their last account. No wonder many
a hand went for the water-bottle, and little nervous
tricks of foot and hand betrayed the tension of the
moment.</p>

<p>“Now then, Devons, get ready!” The men gripped
their rifles in the old way of drill, quick and altogether,
brows were knit, teeth set, and away they went into the
jaws of death.</p>

<p>“Steady, Devons, steady!” No need to bid them be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
steady. They bore down upon the Boers with dogged
and irresistible force, and the Boers turned and ran.
Many an English officer fell that day, and several doctors
were wounded while doing their duty.</p>

<p>The Boers who fought most fiercely were the old
Dopper Boers, who nursed a bitter hatred for all Englishmen.
These men would refuse all kind help even when
lying hurt. They were suspected sometimes of cruelty
to our wounded; for more than one of our men was
found covered with bruises, as though he had been kicked
or beaten to death. But these things were exceptional,
and such conduct was confined to the most ignorant and
uncivilized of the old Boers.</p>

<p>Many of the wounded lay where they fell for twenty-four
hours and more. The Kaffir boys as they dug the long
shallow graves would hum a low refrain; above wheeled
the vultures, looking down upon the slain. The Boers
confessed that it was the worst day they had ever had,
and five days after the battle they were still searching for
their dead. Our dead numbered about 150.</p>

<p>The Imperial Light Horse, containing many young
Englishmen in their ranks, greatly distinguished themselves.
The Brigadier commanding in the fight wrote
to their chief officer: “No one realizes more clearly than
I do that your men were the backbone of the defence
during that day’s long fighting.” But sickness carried
off far more than rifle or cannon. The Imperial Light
Horse, who came to Ladysmith 475 strong, were now
reduced to 150; the Devons, from 984 had gone down
to 480.</p>

<p>As Majuba Day was coming near the messages brought
by the runners became more hopeful: “All going well,”
“Cronje is surrounded.”</p>

<p>But time after time came the news of Buller’s failure
on the Tugela, and with every piece of ill news came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
reduced rations at Ladysmith. The artillery horses were
nearly all eaten, the cavalry horses too; those that remained
were too weak even to raise a trot. Would Buller
ever cut his way through? The garrison were beginning
to despond. If they had to fight a fierce battle again
like that at Cæsar’s Camp a few weeks ago, when the
pick of the Boer forces tried to take it by storm, would
they not reel and faint for very want of food? Then,
when all looked dark, and the far-off sound of Buller’s
guns seemed to be dying away in another failure, something
happened.</p>

<p>Men on outpost duty upon the hills round Ladysmith
saw what seemed to them to be a long white snake
crawling over the veldt. Officers seized their glasses,
and started with an ejaculation of surprise, for what
they saw was a long sinuous line of white-tilted waggons.
“It’s the Boers coming away from the Tugela! By
Jove! it’s a great trek!” Yes, the enemy were in full
retreat at last; Buller had hammered them in so many
places, and now at last he had succeeded.</p>

<p>There they came, waggon after waggon, in endless
succession, as it seemed. Verily, it was a retreat of an
army, for there were thousands of horsemen too, riding
at a hand gallop, singly or in clusters, a continuous
stream of moving figures coming round the corner of
End Hill and then riding north behind Telegraph Hill.
They were seeking their railway base.</p>

<p>But, though they rode fast in retreat, there was no
confusion; the Boers know how to trek, and they do it
well.</p>

<p>Oh! that we had had some horses, good strong horses,
to gallop our guns in their direction. But the horses
were all either eaten or too weak to trot. Those who
looked to Bulwana Hill saw a strange black tripod being
erected above the big Boer gun: they were going to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
the gun away. The gunners of the <i>Powerful</i> saw the
tripod too. They set to work to try and prevent that
work from being accomplished; both the 4·7’s were in
action, and made the red earth fly near the Boer redoubt.</p>

<p>The third shell burst upon the summit of the hill. The
many clusters of men who were watching waited breathlessly
for the white smoke to clear away, and when it
cleared there was no tripod to be seen! Then an exultant
shout rose up from hill-side and from spruit; some in their
excitement danced and sang and shook hands and
laughed. They were weak for want of food, and had not
the usual English restraint. Then a great hailstorm came
drifting by, and there was a rush into the town to tell the
glad news.</p>

<p>What a Babel of talk there was at dinner that evening!
Why, some officers were so hopeful now that they ventured
to predict that by to-morrow some of Buller’s
men would be in Ladysmith.</p>

<p>The dinner of horse-flesh was progressing merrily when
all at once a strange clattering of shoes outside awoke
attention. They listened in the mess-room, and heard
eager voices, cries of men and boys as they hurried past.
One went to the window and shouted: “What’s the
row?”</p>

<p>“Buller’s troopers are in sight; they have been seen
riding across the flats!”</p>

<p>What! Then they all jumped up, and the youngest
and strongest fared forth with the hurrying crowd
towards the nearest river-drift.</p>

<p>On reaching this they saw across the river and the
flat ground beyond, riding down a little ridge, a column
of horsemen trotting towards them. Horsemen at full
trot! Then they could not be any of their men, for their
horses could not trot to save their lives.</p>

<p>The evening sun shone upon their full kit, and no one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
could doubt that it was the relief column at last! God be
thanked!</p>

<p>Now they had pulled up, and were welcomed by some
officers of Sir George White’s staff. Meanwhile the motley
crowd grew, at first too dazed to cheer or shout, but rather
moist about the eyes. Malays were there in their red
fezes, coolies in many-coloured turbans, and white-clad
Indians, dhoolie-bearers, grinning a silent welcome.
But the most excited and the noisiest in all that throng
were the Kaffir boys and Zulus, the Basutos and
Bechuanas. They felt no cold reserve strangle their
expressions of delight, but danced and shouted and leapt
like madmen, showing gleaming white teeth and sparkling
eyes.</p>

<p>As they drew near the town they met many of the sick
and wounded who had hobbled out, in their great joy,
to receive the relievers, and who tried to wave their caps
and say Hurrah! with the rest&mdash;a piteous sight of wan
faces and poor shrunk shanks!</p>

<p>And the men of the Relief Column&mdash;so brown and well
they looked&mdash;were feeling in their pockets for tobacco
to distribute round, for the spectacle they saw of white-faced,
feeble-kneed invalids smote them to the heart.
They had never realized until at this moment all that the
defenders of Ladysmith had suffered for England.</p>

<p>They rode in slowly, two by two, Dundonald and
Gough and Mackenzie of Natal at the head of the column.
All through the main street they rode, nodding to a friend
here and a friend there, for the Imperial Light Horse had
many friends in Ladysmith.</p>

<p>There were wild cheers half choked by emotion, and
the little ones were hoisted on shoulder to be able to see
the strong men who had come to save them. Then in
the twilight came Sir George White and his staff to
welcome the rescue party. As the leaders shook hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
the excitement and joy of relief broke forth again. Men
bit their lips as if nothing was happening, but women
and children cried and laughed and cried again. All in
their heart, many in their voices, were thanking God for
this timely deliverance. And then they fell to and cheered
Sir George White: just then his patient heroism and kindly
grip of power appealed to them. And some who had
not wept before cried now when they looked on the old
soldier, sitting so erect and proud in his saddle, with all
the heavy cloud of care suddenly removed from his brow
and the light of joy and gratitude shining through wet
eyes. Twice&mdash;aye, thrice&mdash;he tried to speak, but the
tears were in his throat and he could not utter his thoughts.
Then the cheers came again, and gave him time to pull
himself together.</p>

<p>He lifted his bowed head and thanked them for all
their loyal help, soldiers and civilians alike, and then
finished by one solemn phrase that touched all hearts:
“Thank God, we kept the old flag flying!”</p>

<p>Why, the very Zulus caught the enthusiasm and leapt
high into the air, waving bare arms aloft and shouting
the old war-cry of Cetewayo and his savage <i>impis</i>. That
night there were long stories to be told in the camp of
the Relief Column.</p>

<p>Mr. Winston Spencer Churchill, M.P., wrote his story
down of how they rode into Ladysmith: “Never shall I
forget that ride. The evening was deliciously cool. My
horse was strong and fresh, for I had changed him at
midday. The ground was rough with many stones, but
we cared little for that&mdash;onward, wildly, recklessly, up
and down hill, over the boulders, through the scrub.
We turned the shoulder of a hill, and there before us lay
the tin houses and dark trees we had come so far to see
and save. The British guns on Cæsar’s Camp were
firing steadily in spite of the twilight. What was happen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>ing?
Never mind, we were nearly through the dangerous
ground. Now we were all on the flat. Brigadier,
staff, and troops let their horses go. We raced through
the thorn-bushes by Intombi Spruit. Suddenly there
was a challenge: ‘Halt! Who goes there?’ ‘The Ladysmith
Relief Column.’ And thereat, from out of trenches
and rifle-pits artfully concealed in the scrub a score of
tattered men came running, cheering feebly, and some
were crying. In the half-light they looked ghastly pale
and thin, but the tall, strong colonial horsemen, standing
up in their stirrups, raised a loud resounding cheer, for
then we knew we had reached the Ladysmith picket-line.”</p>

<p>One word more on Sir Ian Hamilton, one of the greatest
of our soldiers. It was he who held command on Cæsar’s
Hill during those desperate seventeen hours of fighting.
Spare, tall, quiet, smiling, he had the masterful manner
of the born soldier, who fights and makes no fuss about
it, and draws the soldiers after him in the forlornest of
hopes by the magic of his sympathy and valour. Valour
without sympathy, ability without the devotion of your
men, can do little; but when both are united, steel and
lead cannot prevail against them.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI</a><br />
<span class="smaller">SIEGE OF PORT ARTHUR (1904)</span></h2>

<p class="summary">Port Arthur&mdash;Its hotel life&mdash;Stoessel not popular&mdash;Fleet surprised&mdash;Shelled
at twelve miles&mdash;Japanese pickets make a mistake&mdash;Wounded
cannot be brought in&mdash;Polite even under the knife&mdash;The
etiquette of the bath&mdash;The unknown death&mdash;Kondrachenko, the
real hero&mdash;The white flag at last&mdash;Nogi the modest&mdash;“Banzai”&mdash;Effect
of good news on the wounded&mdash;The fleet sink with alacrity.</p>

<p>Port Arthur consists of a small land-locked harbour
surrounded by hills. As you sail into the harbour you
have on your right the Admiralty depots, dock-basin,
and dockyard, sheltered by Golden Hill; next the waterfront,
or commercial quarter; on the left the Tiger’s Tail,
a sand spit which narrows the entrance, behind which
the torpedo-boats lie moored. The new town lies south
of Signal Hill, on a plateau rising to the west. All round
the town were hill-forts elaborately fortified.</p>

<p>The hotels were, like the houses, very primitive: the
best was a one-storied building containing about twenty
rooms, each room being furnished with a camp bedstead
and no bedding, one deal table, and one chair. Sometimes,
if you swore hard at the Chinese coolie, you could
get a small basin of water and a jug. There was a permanent
circus, a Chinese theatre, music-halls, and grog-shops;
a band played on summer evenings.</p>

<p>General Stoessel, the military commander, was not loved
by soldier or citizen: he was very strict, and, during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
war became despotic. They say he once struck a civilian
across the face with his riding-whip because the man
had not noticed and saluted him as he passed. His
soldiers dreaded him, and would slink away at his appearing.
Some such words as these would come from him
on seeing a sentry:</p>

<p>“Who are you? Where do you come from? When
did you join? Why are you so dirty? Take off your
boots and let me inspect your foot-rags? Oh, got an
extra pair in your kit? Show them at once. Go and wash
your face.”</p>

<p>Though it was known that war between Russia and
Japan was imminent, the officers and men of both navy
and army took little heed, but relied on the strength of
their fortress, its fleet, and batteries. What could the
little yellow monkeys do against Russia? Well, on the
7th of February invitations were sent out for a great
reception at the residence of the Port Admiral, for it
was the name-day of his wife and daughter. Officers of
all grades flocked thither from the forts and the ships.
After the reception followed a dance, very enjoyable, gay,
and delightful.</p>

<p>It was midnight, and many were down by the water’s
edge waiting for gig and pinnace. A dull sound echoed
through the streets that night.</p>

<p>“Dear me! what is that, I wonder?”</p>

<p>“Oh! only naval manœuvres, sir. We sailors must be
practising a bit, you know, in case the Japs come.”</p>

<p>Then there was a laugh: “They won’t dare to come
under our guns!”</p>

<p>But they had come! In their torpedo-boats the
brave sailors of the “Rising Sun” were quietly steaming
round the harbour, launching a deadly torpedo at battleship
and cruiser.</p>

<p>Next morning, when the Russians went down to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
what was going on, they found the <i>Retvisan</i> nose down
and heeling over, the <i>Tsarevich</i> settling down by the stern
and with a pretty list to starboard, other vessels looking
very uncomfortable, and a long way off, near the horizon,
some black specks that actually “had the cheek” to
bombard Port Arthur.</p>

<p>Why, yes, as the curious citizen came to the Bund,
he was so astonished that he forgot to run. Crates and
sacks had been hurled about, double glass windows all
smashed; and what was that big hole on the quay, big
enough to hold an omnibus and four horses? “Good
gracious! you don’t mean to say that those specks
twelve miles away have done all this! Come, sir, let us
seek shelter in the stone-quarries.”</p>

<p>And the Russian batteries on Golden Hill? They
were returning the fire from 10-inch guns; but the
Japanese possessed 13-inch guns and were outside
striking distance.</p>

<p>A party of ladies and gentlemen had gone to the
terrace before the Mayor’s house to see the pretty
sight&mdash;it is not often you can see such a sight. A
shell fell just below them! They scattered and went
to bed.</p>

<p>“What was it like? Oh, my dear, a noise like a big
rocket, a blaze, a bang, an awful clatter all round, as the
glass breaks and falls. You are dazed, you see yellow
smoke, you smell something nasty, you shake&mdash;you run&mdash;run!”</p>

<p>Yes, they all ran away from Port Arthur, all who could&mdash;merchants,
tradesmen, coolies&mdash;all went by train or
boat. Then there were no bakers or butchers, no servants,
until the Russian troops were ordered to take the vacant
places.</p>

<p>If the Japanese had only known they might have
taken Port Arthur that night of the torpedo attack;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
but they left the Russians sixteen days of quiet to recover
from their panic and to repair their ships. Then it was
more difficult.</p>

<p>The hole in the <i>Retvisan</i> was 40 feet long and 20 feet
in depth. Seven compartments were full of water, and
many dead bodies floated in them. But, beached and
water-logged as she was, she used her guns with
effect many times during the siege, so difficult is it to
destroy a battleship unless you can sink her in deep
water.</p>

<p>It was not long before all foreigners, newspaper correspondents,
or candid friends were ordered out of Port
Arthur, so we have to rely on the evidence of those who
witnessed the siege from the Japanese side. Even they
did not at first find their freedom to see and pass from
one hill to another very secure. One night two of them
tried to get to the front under cover of the darkness.
They soon met a Japanese officer, who reined in and asked
where they were going. One of them could speak Japanese,
and replied that they were looking for their camp. So
he let them go. But what if they stumbled upon the
Japanese outposts and were shot at as Russians? They
must be very wary. In the starlight they saw a small
hill in front of them, which they made for, hoping to see
or hear more of the great fight which sounded louder as
they walked&mdash;a roar of rifles broken by the rattle of
machine-guns. As they climbed one of them said he
saw a trench near the top of the hill and men sitting near
it. They hesitated, but finally made up their minds to
risk it, and advanced boldly, whistling carelessly as they
went. The Japanese were all looking out in front, and
did not at first notice the new-comers, who approached
from behind. Then suddenly the thought came, “We
are being taken in flank by the Russians.” The entire
picket started to their feet. Many of them had been fast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
asleep, and, being aroused to hear the noise of heavy
firing, they called out “Ruskies!” One Englishman tried
to seize a Japanese by the hand to show he was a friend,
but his intention failed, for both of them rolled into the
trench. The other threw himself flat on the ground and
called out in Japanese, “English friends!”</p>

<div class="caption">

<p class="header">A Russian Torpedo-boat Destroyer eluding the Japanese Fleet</p>

<p>During the siege of Port Arthur the <i>Raztoropny</i>, with despatches, ran safely through the Japanese men-of-war in the teeth of a
tremendous storm. She was pursued, but reached Chifu harbour, and her crew, having achieved their object, blew her up.</p></div>
</div>

<p>When at last the Japanese discovered their mistake they
were all smiles and apologies, and “Please go to the
front, sir.”</p>

<p>The Japanese made great mistakes at first: they lost
many thousands by attacking in front hills and forts
scientifically fortified. They were trying to do what
was impossible. Some years before they had captured
Port Arthur from the Chinese speedily and easily by a
fierce assault. They had then been compelled by Russia,
France, and Germany to give up their fair prize of victory.
Afterwards Russia had seized Port Arthur and Manchuria.
So honour and revenge both spurred on the Japanese
to retake it from the Russians. The war became most
cruel and sanguinary.</p>

<p>After one night attack the Japanese left 7,000 dead
and wounded on the hill-side. They could not fetch them
in, though they were within call. Some few crawled
back to their friends at night; many lay out for days,
being fed by biscuits and balls of rice thrown from the
Japanese trenches&mdash;the Japanese were fed almost entirely
on rice.</p>

<p>A naval surgeon tells a story which explains the
conduct of the Japanese when suffering intense pain.
He says:</p>

<p>“When the battleship <i>Hatsure</i> was sunk in May, a
sailor was laid on the operating-table who had a piece
of shell 2½ inches long bedded in his right thigh. I
offered him a cigar as he came in, which he eagerly
took, but the surgeon told him not to smoke it just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
then. His smaller injuries were first attended to, and
then the surgeon turned to the severe wound in the
man’s thigh.</p>

<p>“In order to pull out the piece of steel still embedded
in the limb, he was obliged to pass his hand into the
wound, which was deep enough to hide it as far as the
wrist. During this painful operation the sailor never
spoke or winced, but kept trying to reach the breast-pocket
of his coat. At length the surgeon, irritated by
his fidgety manner, asked: ‘What are you doing? Why
can’t you keep quiet?’</p>

<p>“The sailor replied: ‘I want to give that English
gentleman a cigarette in exchange for the cigar he
kindly gave me.’ Even in the throes of that agony the
Japanese sailor could not forget his politeness and
gratitude.”</p>

<p>They are a curious mixture of opposites, these Japanese&mdash;one
day facing machine-guns like fiends incarnate,
or giving their bodies to be used as a human ladder in
attempt to escalade a fort, the next day sucking sweetmeats
like little boys. You come upon some groups by
a creek: they are laughing and playing practical jokes
as they sharpen up their bayonets with busy, innocent
faces, making ready for the great assault at dawn to-morrow.
A few yards further on you find them in all
states of undress, their underwear fluttering to the breeze,
some of them sitting on the stones and tubbing with real
soap. You ask them, Why so busy this afternoon?
They smile and nod their heads towards Port Arthur,
and one who speaks English explains that they had been
taught at school this proverb: “Japanese fight like gentlemen,
and if they are found dead on the field, they will be
found like gentlemen, clean and comely.”</p>

<p>There were so many forms of death in this siege&mdash;<i>plurima
mortis imago</i>, as Virgil says&mdash;from the speedy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
bullet to the common shell, shrapnel, and pom-pom.
But besides these common inventions there were mines
that exploded under their feet as they walked, hand-grenades
thrown in their faces as they approached the
forts; there were pits filled with petroleum ready to be
lit by an electric wire, and poisonous gases to be flung
from wide-mouthed mortars. But the one which spread
terror even amongst the bravest was what they called
“the unknown death.” It was said that during the
early attacks in August, one whole line of infantry which
was rushing to the assault had fallen dead side by side,
and that no wounds had been found on them. At last
it was discovered the Russian chief electrician had ordered
a “live” wire to be placed among the ordinary wire
entanglements, furnished with a current strong enough
to kill anyone who touched it.</p>

<p>Of course, it was liable to be destroyed by shell or
cannon fire, but in many cases it proved fatal, and always
made the attackers nervous. The Russians had such
steel-wire entanglements placed at the foot of all their
positions, and where success depended on the dash and
speed of the infantry, they succeeded in stopping them
and exposing them to a heavy fire. As a rule, volunteers
went out at night with strong wire-nippers and cut the
strands, or they set fire to the wooden posts and let them
come to the ground together. Sometimes in a fierce
charge the sappers used to lie down beneath the wires,
pretending to be dead, and choose a moment for using
their nippers; some even, in their desperate efforts to
get through, would seize the wire between their teeth
and try and bite it through.</p>

<p>The man among the Russians who was the mainspring
of the defence was General Kondrachenko. He was an
eminent engineer, very popular with the men, one of
the bravest and most scientific of the Russian officers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
On the 15th of December the General and his staff were
sitting inside North Keikwansan Fort, in the concrete
barrack just underneath the spot where a shell had made
a hole in the roof. This had been repaired, and they had
come to see if it had been well done. As luck would
have it, a second 28-centimetre shell came through the
same place and burst inside the barrack, killing the
gallant Kondrachenko and eight other officers who were
with him. This was the gravest blow that Port Arthur
could have suffered, for this man was the spirit of resistance
personified.</p>

<p>After his death Stoessel began to seek for excuses to
surrender. He called a council of war, and proposed that,
as the Japanese had taken so many forts and sunk their
warships, terms of surrender should be proposed. Almost
every one was opposed to it, and some officers were so
disgusted that they privately suggested kidnapping
Stoessel and locking him up.</p>

<p>The Japanese policy of mining and firing mines under
the redoubts had succeeded so often that the Russians
had got into a nervous state. On the 1st of January
the fort of Wantai was rushed and captured; mountain-guns
and quick-firers were sent up to help in holding the
ground, ammunition was sent forward, everything made
ready to rush the whole of the eastern defences, when, to
the astonishment of all, from General to private, a white
flag was seen fluttering over the valley. The news spread
like wild-fire that Stoessel wished to capitulate. Could
it be possible?</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="img_16" src="images/i_377.jpg" width="423" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption">

<p class="header">A Human Ladder</p>

<p>The Japanese soldiers made their bodies practically into a ladder, and thus enabled
their comrades to escalade a fort.</p></div>
</div>

<p>At 9 a.m. on the following morning, the 2nd of January,
a little group of foreign pressmen assembled as usual in
the small room provided for them at head-quarters.
They discussed the white flag incident; but they remembered
that Stoessel had said that he would die in the last
ditch, so it did not seem probable. Captain Zasuhara,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
whose duty it was to inform them of what was going on,
was late in appearing, and when the door opened, it
was not the Captain, but an orderly, who entered, carrying
a tray on which was a bottle of liqueur brandy and
several glasses. Something strange must be going to
happen when a Japanese officer begins drinking liqueur
so early!</p>

<p>A few moments later Captain Zasuhara came in.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, General Stoessel has capitulated; Port
Arthur has surrendered. Banzai!”</p>

<p>They all joined in the shout “Banzai!” which means
“Live for ever!” and then gave three lusty Saxon cheers,
which brought out General Nogi, the Commander-in-Chief.
He who for so many months had borne the grave
responsibility of sending so many thousands to their
death, he who had lost both his sons before Port Arthur,
and tried so hard to conceal his grief, now beamed with
joy at the sudden relief, and the lines that used to seam
his forehead were smoothed out and almost invisible.
A grand gentleman was Nogi, gentle and polite and kind
to all. Who could have grudged him this triumph after
so much sorrow and disappointment?</p>

<p>He offered his hand, received their congratulations with
dignity, and said with an under-current of sadness and
a voice as soft as a woman’s: “I thank you all for staying
with me through the dark days of disappointment and
all the sorrowful hours of this terrible siege.”</p>

<p>The proud spirit of the Samurai soldier seemed blended
with the gentle feeling of the Buddhist. It was a touching
sight to have seen.</p>

<p>And how the news stirred the troops! Men broke into
snatches of song, then shouted and yelled “Banzai!”
until they choked. In the field-hospitals the wounded,
trying to rise from their canvas stretchers, joined in the
cheering with thin, weak voices. At night wood fires<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
were lit all round the hills, and many of the Russian
garrison left their dismal forts and came down to sip
<i>saké</i> (rice wine), and after spending a night of carousal
with their late enemies, the big, burly foemen of the North
were glad to be helped homewards by their polite hosts,
who bowed on leaving them and hoped they would not
suffer from the after-effects of Japanese hospitality.</p>

<p>Astonishing, too, was the effect of the good news on
the wounded. Desperately wounded men crawled over
the stony hills and walked to the hospitals without aid.
If you said to one such, “You are badly hurt; let me give
you an arm,” he smiled proudly, and said with a salute,
“No, no; Port Arthur has fallen!”</p>

<p>One man who had been shot in the head, and whose
right arm had been smashed to pieces by a shell, walked
to the dressing-station, had his arm amputated and his
head dressed, and then walked two miles further to the
field-hospital. The news was too good for him to think
of his own pain. Another man had a bullet through
his chest. He walked two miles to the hospital; there
he coolly asked the surgeon if he thought he might live.
The surgeon, though he knew the man’s case was hopeless,
said, “Oh yes; but” (after a pause) “if you have any
letter you wish written, do it at once.” The soldier
replied, “All I desire is that a letter should be written
to my mother.” No sooner had he uttered these words
than he fell dead on the spot. It reminds one of a young
Lieutenant in Browning’s poem, who had ridden with
dispatches to Napoleon. “Why, my boy, you are
wounded!” “Nay, sire; I am killed.”</p>

<p>In the harbour at Port Arthur there were riding at
anchor five battleships and two cruisers. On the 10th of
August they had gone out to meet Admiral Togo, and had
returned next day badly damaged.</p>

<p>By the 1st of September they had been repaired.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
But on November the 27th began a tremendous battle
for the possession of 203 Metre Hill. On the 5th of
December that hill was taken at a fearful cost of lives,
and a Japanese naval Lieutenant wormed his way into
the shallow trench and by help of his nautical instruments
was able to take observations and give the correct direction
and distance to the artillery commander, who at once
trained Howitzers on the fleet. All the ships were sunk
by the 6th of December, with the exception of the <i>Sevastopol</i>,
which steamed out under Captain von Essen and
anchored under the batteries of Tiger’s Tail.</p>

<p>This brave officer tried to protect his ship by a wooden
boom and by torpedo-nets. For three nights he was
attacked by Japanese boats and torpedoes, and inflicted
great damage on them. At last the boom was pierced
and the ship’s steering-gear ruined by a torpedo. The
<i>Sevastopol</i> showed signs of settling down, so that night
steam was got up for the last time, and the gallant
commander with a few picked men took her out into
deep water, opened the sluice-cocks, and then, taking
to his launch, pulled away a bit and watched the great
battleship settle down stern first in the dim and misty
moonlight.</p>

<p>It is only right that the pluck of this Russian Captain
should be remembered when we think of the poor defence
made by the Russian Navy.</p>

<p>As for the rest of the fleet, the battleships and cruisers
were huddled together with a strong list and their upper
works destroyed. They have since been raised and repaired,
and belong to the Mikado.</p>

<p>The siege of Port Arthur cost General Nogi’s army
89,000 men in killed, wounded, and sick; of these 10,000
were officers.</p>

<p>The Japanese have read a great lesson in patriotism
and sense of duty to the whole world. To the courtly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
and feudal chivalry of their old-world Samurai, or Noble,
they have added the foresight and inventive genius of
the European. They have suddenly sprung into the front
rank of civilized nations, and no one can forecast the
greatness of their future.</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
